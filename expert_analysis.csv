0,"Efficient and selective method to separate triterpene acids by direct treatment of apple peels with alkaline ethanol Triterpene acid extraction from dried apple peels of Fuji and Gala varieties in 2%NaOH/ethanol at room temperature, followed by filtration and acidification (pH 3), was investigated, comparing to a classical exhaustive extraction (Soxhlet, 2 h, with ethanol and methanol, >97% recovery). Alkali-ethanol process yielded 4.35–6.86% (w/w) of whitish extracts, up to 15 times less than Soxhlet but with same recovery (P > 0.05) of ursolic and oleanolic acids. Alkaline extraction of previously defatted peels led to same recovery (P > 0.05), but the yield increased slightly (P < 0.01). The cost-effective and environmental-friendly procedure prepares triterpene-rich extracts from apple peels at high recovery, directly eliminating the cutin and avoiding prior treatments with hazardous organic solvents. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.

1,"Lutzomyia Iongipalpis Saliva Induces Heme Oxygenase-1 Expression at Bite Sites Sand flies bite mammalian hosts to obtain a blood meal, driving changes in the host inflammatory response that support the establishment of Leishmania infection. This effect is partially attributed to components of sand fly saliva, which are able to recruit and activate leukocytes. Our group has shown that heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) favors Leishmania survival in infected cells by reducing inflammatory responses. Here, we show that exposure to sand fly bites is associated with induction of HO-1 in vivo. Histopathological analyses of skin specimens from human volunteers experimentally exposed to sand fly bites revealed that HO-1 and Nrf2 are produced at bite sites in the skin. These results were recapitulated in mice ears injected with a salivary gland sonicate (SGS) or exposed to sand fly bites, indicating that vector saliva may be a key factor in triggering HO-1 expression. Resident skin macrophages were the main source HO-1 at 24-48 h after bites. Additionally, assays in vivo after bites and in vitro after stimulation with saliva both demonstrated that HO-1 production by macrophages was Nrf2-dependent. Collectively, our data demonstrates that vector saliva induces early HO-1 production at the bite sites, representing a major event associated with establishment of naturally-transmitted Leishmania infections.

3,"Prevalence of obesity, high blood pressure, dyslipidemia and their associated factors in children and adolescents in a municipality in the Brazilian Amazon region Introduction: The incidence of chronic noncommunicable disease (CND) are rocketting over the world, including in young adults. The WHO estimates that more than half of the deaths in the world, even in underdeveloped countries, are caused by CND. Objectives: The study aimed to estimate the prevalence of obesity, high blood pressure (HBP) and dyslipidemia and its associated factors. Methods: The authors carried out a cross-sectional study of 1,431 schools in the public-school system of Monte, Brazilian Western Amazon, with children and adolescents aged 6 to 15 years. A random sampling of 496 individuals was carried out. The OpenEpi platform was used to calculate the sample size, considering p<0.05 and a presumed prevalence of CND of 50%. The authors applied a clinical-epidemiological questionnaire, made anthropometric measurements and laboratory tests. Diagnostic parameters recommended by the recent guidelines of the Ministry of Health in Brazil were used. Results: Prevalence of CND was: Obesity 11.8%, HBP of 6.7% and dyslipidemia of 25.4%. After multivariate log-binomial analysis of the dependent variables, the statistically significant risk factors were overweight 18.4%, sedentary lifestyle 32.2%, family history of cardiovascular disease 23.4%, family history of HBP 84.2%, family dyslipidemia 55.8%, family obesity 38.7% and family chronic renal disease 40.6%. Conclusion: The findings pointed out to a context with a relatively high prevalence of CND, as well as their associated factors. Intervention measures such as health education, food education, stimulation of physical exercise, better school feeding and an improvement of the public health system are needed to mitigate the occurrence of CND. © The authors (2020), this article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons license, and indicate if changes were made.

4,"Cynomolgus macaques naturally infected with Trypanosoma cruzi-I exhibit an overall mixed pro-inflammatory/modulated cytokine signature characteristic of human Chagas disease Background: Non-human primates have been shown to be useful models for Chagas disease. We previously reported that natural T. cruzi infection of cynomolgus macaques triggers clinical features and immunophenotypic changes of peripheral blood leukocytes resembling those observed in human Chagas disease. In the present study, we further characterize the cytokine-mediated microenvironment to provide supportive evidence of the utility of cynomolgus macaques as a model for drug development for human Chagas disease. Methods and findings: In this cross-sectional study design, flow cytometry and systems biology approaches were used to characterize the ex vivo and in vitro T. cruzi-specific functional cytokine signature of circulating leukocytes from TcI-T. cruzi naturally infected cynomolgus macaques (CH). Results showed that CH presented an overall CD4+-derived IFN-γ pattern regulated by IL-10-derived from CD4+T-cells and B-cells, contrasting with the baseline profile observed in non-infected hosts (NI). Homologous TcI-T. cruzi-antigen recall in vitro induced a broad pro-inflammatory cytokine response in CH, mediated by TNF from innate/adaptive cells, counterbalanced by monocyte/B-cell-derived IL-10. TcIV-antigen triggered a more selective cytokine signature mediated by NK and T-cell-derived IFN-γ with modest regulation by IL-10 from T-cells. While NI presented a cytokine network comprised of small number of neighborhood connections, CH displayed a complex cross-talk amongst network elements. Noteworthy, was the ability of TcI-antigen to drive a complex global pro-inflammatory network mediated by TNF and IFN-γ from NK-cells, CD4+and CD8+T-cells, regulated by IL-10+CD8+T-cells, in contrast to the TcIV-antigens that trigger a modest network, with moderate connecting edges. Conclusions: Altogether, our findings demonstrated that CH present a pro-inflammatory/regulatory cytokine signature similar to that observed in human Chagas disease.

5,"Do climate changes alter the distribution and transmission of malaria? Evidence assessment and recommendations for future studies Malaria, a mosquito-borne infectious disease, is considered a significant global health burden. Climate changes or different weather conditions may impact infectious diseases, specifically those transmitted by insect vectors and contaminated water. Based on the current predictions for climate change associated with the increase in carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere and the increase in atmospheric temperature, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts that in 2050, malaria may threaten some previously unexposed areas worldwide and cause a 50% higher probability of malaria cases. Climate-based distribution models of malaria depict an increase in the geographic distribution of the disease as global environmental temperatures and conditions worsen. Researchers have studied the influence of changes in climate on the prevalence of malaria using different mathematical models that consider different variables and predict the conditions for malaria distribution. In this context, we conducted a mini-review to elucidate the important aspects described in the literature on the influence of climate change in the distribution and transmission of malaria. It is important to develop possible risk management strategies and enhance the surveillance system enhanced even in currently malaria-free areas predicted to experience malaria in the future.

6,"Free-living amoebae and their relationship to air quality in hospital environments: characterization of Acanthamoeba spp. obtained from air-conditioning systems Free-living amoebae (FLA) are widely dispersed in the environment, can cause opportunistic and non-opportunistic infections in humans and other animals. The aim of the present study was characterize FLA obtained from air-conditioners of a public hospital in the city of Florianopolis, SC, Brazil. Fifty-four dust samples were collected of air conditioners, and were inoculated on 1.5% non-nutrient agar, overlaid with layers of Escherichia coli. Subsequently the isolates were axenised in PYG growth medium. The morphological and molecular characterization of the isolates was performed, as well as the tolerance (physiological) assays were used to evaluate the pathogenic potential. The results revealed the presence of FLA in 42 (77.8%) of the collected samples. Of these, 39 (92.9%) axenic isolates of FLA were obtained for morphological and genotypic studies. All the isolates characterized belong to the genus Acanthamoeba. Nineteen (48.7%) isolates belong to the genotype T4, 16 (41.0%) to the T5 genotype and 4 (10.3%) to genotype T11. Seven (18.0%) isolates were considered potentially pathogenic in tolerance assays.

7,"Biannual and Quarterly Comparison Analysis of Agglutinating Antibody Kinetics on a Subcohort of Individuals Exposed to Leptospira interrogans in Salvador, Brazil. IntroductionLeptospirosis is a zoonosis with a worldwide spread that leads to clinical manifestations ranging from asymptomatic infection to a life-threatening disease. The immune response is predominantly humoral mediated limited to the infecting serovar. Individuals living in an area endemic for leptospirosis are often exposed to an environment contaminated with leptospires and there is a paucity of information on naturally acquired immunity. In the present study, we evaluated the kinetics of agglutinating antibodies in individuals from an endemic area for leptospirosis in Salvador, Brazil comparing two different intersample collection times. MethodsBetween 2017-2018, we carried out a biannual prospective cohort with 2,086 individuals living in an endemic area for leptospirosis in Salvador, Brazil. To compare agglutinating antibody kinetics using microscopic agglutination test (MAT) with different collection times, a subcohort of 72 individuals with quarterly follow-up was carried out in parallel. ResultsThe results revealed that using a shorter time for intersample collection led to the detection of a higher number of infections and reinfection events. Furthermore, we observed a higher rate of titer decay indicating partial and short protection. However, there was no indication of major changes in risk factors for the disease. ConclusionsWe evaluated antibody kinetics among residents of an endemic area for leptospirosis comparing two sample collection times. The constant exposure to the contaminated environment increases the risk for leptospirosis infection with reinfection events being more common than expected. This indicates that the burden of leptospirosis might be underestimated by serological surveys, and further studies are necessary to better characterize the humoral response after infection.

8,"Excess deaths from respiratory causes in eight Brazilian metropolises during the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic In Brazil, one of the countries most heavily affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, mortality data fail to reflect the real number of deaths from the disease. The study aimed to estimate excess deaths from respiratory causes and their trends during the first six month of the COVID-19 epidemic in adults 20 years or older in eight regional metropolises in Brazil. In this ecological study, deaths from respiratory causes (influenza, pneumonias, bronchitis, other chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, acute or chronic respiratory failure, respiratory failure or respiratory disorder not otherwise specified, and other deaths coded with respiratory symptoms) were extracted from the Mortality Information System. Expected deaths were estimated with quasi- Poisson generalized additive models. From February 23 to August 8, 2020, 46,028 deaths from respiratory causes were recorded in the eight cities, with an excess of 312% (95%CI: 304- 321). Manaus (Amazonas State), presented the highest excess, with 758% (95%CI: 668-858) and Sao Paulo the lowest, with 174% (95% CI: 164-183). Early excess mortality was detected in Epidemiological Weeks (EW) 9-12 in Belem (Para State), Fortaleza (Ceara State), and Sao Paulo. In general, excess mortality was relatively higher in the 40-59-year age bracket and in men. Excess mortality was regionally heterogeneous, with 2,463% (95%CI: 1,881-3,281) in EW 17-20 in Manaus (North Region) and 808% (95%CI: 612-1,059) in EW 28- 32 in Curitiba (Parana State, South Region). The high and heterogeneous percentage of excess respiratory deaths suggests high underreporting of COVID-19 deaths, which highlights regional inequalities and the need for revision of deaths associated with respiratory symptoms.

9,"Leishmania braziliensis Subverts Necroptosis by Modulating RIPK3 Expression Leishmania braziliensis infection causes skin ulcers, typically found in localized cutaneous leishmaniasis (LCL). This tissue pathology associates with different modalities of cell necrosis, which are subverted by the parasite as a survival strategy. Herein we examined the participation of necroptosis, a specific form of programmed necrosis, in LCL lesions and found reduced RIPK3 and PGAM5 gene expression compared to normal skin. Assays using infected macrophages demonstrated that the parasite deactivates both RIPK3 and MLKL expression and that these molecules are important to control the intracellular L. braziliensis replication. Thus,LCL-related necroptosis may be targeted to control infection and disease immunopathology.

11,"Barriers to Access the Pap Smear Test for Cervical Cancer Screening in Rural Riverside Populations Covered by a Fluvial Primary Healthcare Team in the Amazon Cervical cancer is a major public health problem, especially in the north region of Brazil. The aim of the study was to identify the factors associated with not undergoing the cervical cancer screening test in rural riverside populations in the Amazon. A cross-sectional home-based survey was carried out in 38 locations covered by a fluvial primary healthcare team, and the administrative records of the screening tests from January 2016 to May 2019 were analyzed. After the descriptive analysis, logistic regression was performed considering the outcome of having undergone cervical cancer screening within the past three years. Of the 221 women assessed, 8.1% had never undergone the test, and 7.7% had undergone it more than three years ago. Multiparity (OR = 0.76 (95%CI = 0.64-0.90)), occupation in domestic activities (OR = 0.31 (95%CI = 0.11-0.89)), and lack of knowledge of the healthcare unit responsible for the service (OR = 0.18 (95%CI = 0.04-0.97)) were associated with not undergoing the cervical cancer screening test. The administrative records revealed that the screening test was performed outside the recommended age range (24%), performed needlessly (9.6%) with undue repetitions (3.2%), and a high percentage of the samples collected were unsatisfactory (23.5%). The findings revealed the existence of barriers for riverside women to access cervical cancer screening tests. uterine cervical neoplasms,cancer screening tests,rural population,access to health services International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health",Ciências da Saúde,Saúde Coletiva,Saúde Pública,Ciências da Saúde,Saúde Coletiva,Saúde Pública
12,"The importance of bioelectrical impedance in the critical pediatric patient Background & aims: Sepsis is still a significant cause of death in the Intensive Care Unit and its early diagnosis is vital. Changes in cell permeability have been observed early in sepsis. Lower values of bioelectrical impedance (BIA) such as reactance adjusted by height (Xc/H) and phase angle (PA) have already been studied as a prognostic biomarker for many diseases and may indicate cell injury. BIA is a low cost, practical, noninvasive method that can be measured at bedside. This study investigated the utility of PA and Xc/H raw values in the pediatric critical care unit as predictors of progression to septic shock, as a clinical monitoring tool and to support the diagnosis of septic shock. Methods: We prospectively analyzed bioelectrical impedance in 145 children aged between one month and six years who were not in septic shock on admission to the intensive care unit Serial bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) measures were analyzed to determine the sensitivity and specificity of accurately identifying children who subsequently developed septic shock. Kaplan-Meier septic shock-free survival curves modeled by Xc/H and PA were done. Results: The free-septic shock survival curve analysis showed that patients with the lowest median values of Xc/H and PA were associated with the highest percentage of occurrence of septic shock (p = 0.0001 for Xc/H and <0.0006 for PA) and longest length of stay in the intensive care unit (p < 0.0011 for Xc/H and p < 0.004 for PA). Values of Xc/H below 48.63 Ohm/m at admission showed statistically significant odds ratio (OR) of 3.72 for developing septic shock any time during the hospitalization period, with a 87% sensitivity, 35% specificity and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.62. The PA at admission did not show significant results. During hospitalization, patients with Xc/H below 35.72 Ohm/m were 3.38 times more likely to develop septic shock in the next day, with a sensitivity of 66.7%, a specificity of 62.3% and AUC of 0.65. PA values below 3.27 had an OR of 9.58 for a septic shock the next day with a sensitivity of 95.8%, specificity of 29.4% and AUC of 0.62. The presence of a value of Xc/H below 33 Ohm/m showed a strong association with the occurrence of septic shock on the same day of the measurement, with an OR of 11.7, as well as a value of PA below 2.64, showed an OR of 14.2. Conclusions: The bioelectrical parameters Xc/H and phase angle have limitations in predicting septic shock as isolated biomarkers, but have a potential role as a monitoring tool in the pediatric intensive care unit. The comparative value with other biomarkers remains to be elucidated. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism. All rights reserved.

13,"Identification of a novel alphavirus related to the encephalitis complexes circulating in southern Brazil In early 2017, an outbreak caused by an unknown and supposedly viral agent in the Marilena region of southern Brazil was investigated. Since the etiological agent causing the outbreak was not identified from human samples, mosquitoes from this region were collected. Three out of 121 mosquito pools collected from the region tested positive for alphavirus in molecular tests. Next generation sequencing results revealed the presence of a novel alphavirus, tentatively named here as Caainguá virus (CAAV). DNA barcoding analyses indicated that different species of Culex are hosts for CAAV. This new virus was basal to the New World encephalitic alphaviruses in a comprehensive and robust phylogenetic approach using complete genomes. Viral particles were observed in the cytosol and inside of intracellular compartments of cells in mosquito-derived cell cultures. Despite being noninfectious in vertebrate derived cell cultures, primary culturing of CAAV in human mononuclear cells suggests monocytes and lymphocytes as CAAV targets. However, the epidemiological link of CAAV on the human outbreak should be further explored. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

14,"Children's Protagonism in a Science Exhibition: an Exploratory Study of an Exhibition in Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) Despite the fact that the majority of museum visitors are often very young children, much research in museums focuses on pre-teen learners (ages 8-12). Our goal in this study was to investigate the behaviors of children aged 5-8 during a visit to a science exhibition. We aim to develop a methodology to assess children's levels of engagement with the interactive exhibits and how the participation of explainers (mediation) affected this engagement. Our working hypothesis was that different activities (and different kinds of mediation) would generate different levels of engagement. We recorded videos from 13 groups of 5- to 8-year-old children visiting Aventuras pelo corpo humano, an interactive exhibition about the human body. A large data set including thousands of excerpts of video-taped activity was analyzed using collaborative, online, qualitative data analysis software (Dedoose). The results suggest that the type of mediation overrides the design of the exhibition when it comes to children visitors' experiences and that, despite their emphasis on promoting visitor engagement, explainer mediation strategies often represented deficit and banking models of teaching and learning, highlighting the importance of training for explainers that goes beyond content training and focuses on strategies of mediation that promote learner agency and protagonism. This study confirms previous empirical insights, which can help guide the design of future exhibitions as well as professional development of explainers and science communicators.

Methods We used the Supporting Policy Relevant Reviews and Trials tools for evidence-informed health policymaking and followed eight steps: 1) capacity building; 2) identification of a priority policy issue within a Brazilian public health system; 3) meetings with policy-makers, researchers and stakeholders; 4) development of an evidence brief (EB) that addresses the problem of deinstitutionalization; 5) facilitating policy dialogue (PD); 6) the evaluation of the EB and PD; 7) post-dialogue mini-interviews; and 8) dissemination of the findings. Results Capacity building and meetings with key informants promoted awareness about the gap between research and practice. Local findings were used to define the problem and develop the EB. Twenty-four individuals (policy-makers, stakeholders, researchers, representatives of the civil society, and public defense) participated in the PD. They received the EB to subsidise their deliberations during the PD, which in turn were used to validate and improve the EB. The PD achieved the objective of promoting an exhaustive discussion about the problem and proposed options and improved communication and interaction among those who are involved in mental health care. The features of both the EB and PD were considered to be favorable and helpful. Conclusions The KT strategy helped participants understand different perspectives and values, the interpersonal tensions that exist among those who are involved in the field of mental health, and the strategies that can bridge the gap between research and policy-making. The present findings suggest that PDs can influence practice by promoting greater engagement among stakeholders who formulate or revise mental health policies. evidence-informed policy,knowledge translation,health policy,policy-making,deinstitutionalization,mental health Frontiers in pharmacology",Ciências da Saúde,Saúde Coletiva,,Ciências da Saúde,Saúde Coletiva,Saúde Pública

20,"Visceral leishmaniasis: a practical strategy for quantitative molecular diagnosis in naturally infected dogs The diagnosis of canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) has been a problem for public health services due to the variety of clinical signs similar to other diseases and low sensitivity and specificity of available tests. In this sense, our main objective was to develop a simple, rapid, and accurate quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) diagnosis for CVL. Thus, low-invasive samples from bone marrow (BM), popliteal lymph nodes (PLN), and conjunctival swabs (CS) were selected from negative and VL-positive dogs, using as gold standard, immunological and parasitological tests performed with different tissues. Oligonucleotides for Leishmania infantum kDNA were designed and the limit of quantification and amplification efficiency of the qPCR were determined using tissue-specific standards produced with DNA from those different tissues, mixed with DNA from a known amount of L. infantum promastigotes. Endogenous control was used to validate a comparative Ct method, and tissue parasite concentrations were estimated by comparison with tissue-specific reference standard samples. The overall analysis of the qPCR data suggests the following ranking for tissue choice: PLN > BM > CS. Finally, we have concluded that this molecular approach simplifies and accelerates the quantitative diagnostic process because it is easy to perform, requiring no DNA dosing or standard curve application, and it shows good diagnostic parameters, especially when using popliteal lymph node samples.

21,"Adequate solid waste management as a protection factor against dengue cases Objective. To investigate whether solid waste management and municipal socioeconomic indicators are associated with incidence rates of dengue, Zika, and Chikungunya in municipalities located in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Methods. This exploratory, quantitative, cross-sectional study included all the 853 municipalities of Minas Gerais. Only secondary data were used, collected and grouped according to planning regions. Independent variables included regular urban solid waste collection, separated waste collection, and urban solid waste mass, in addition to a quality indicator of final waste disposal, municipal human development and Gini indices, monthly per capita income, and percentage of population vulnerable to poverty. The factors potentially associated with outcomes - municipal incidence of dengue, Chikungunya, and Zika - were initially selected by univariate analysis, followed by linear regression analysis for the incidence of dengue, Chikungunya, or Zika using the predictors selected through univariate analysis. Results. Solid waste management was not associated with incidence of Zika or Chikungunya. In turn, the incidence of dengue was associated with solid waste management and had a significant inverse association with percent population vulnerable to poverty. A direct association was also observed with Gini index, suggesting that the higher the incidence of dengue from 2007 to 2016, the higher the municipal Gini coefficient and thus social inequality. Selective waste collection was inversely and significantly correlated with dengue cases, suggesting that the lower the coverage by regular separated waste collection, the higher the number of dengue cases. Conclusions.Solid waste management may influence the occurrence of dengue cases, and therefore should be considered in the planning of public health actions.

23,"Evaluability Study of the Health Research Induction Program in Brazil to Mitigate Problems Related to Extreme Poverty The multidimensionality of poverty was a central premise of the Brazil Without Poverty Plan (2011-2014), which aimed to eradicate extreme poverty in the country. The Oswaldo Cruz Foundation coordinated a health research induction program that promoted investigations aimed at producing knowledge to mitigate problems related to poverty. The evaluability study was guided by the theoretical-methodological instrument of the Theory of Change, which allowed tracing the path from the initial scenario to an expected scenario, based on the results of the induction, represented in the logical model of the program, in which the structure, processes and results were also described. Based on the documentary analysis and interviews with stakeholders from the institutions involved, it was possible to identify the program's objectives, the expected results, the public benefited by the program and the public benefited by the evaluation of the program's results. This study guided the planning of the evaluation that followed, as well as the definition of the Canadian model for measuring the return on investment in health research as a methodological strategy. The limitations were recognized, as well as the points that favored the implementation and development of the induction program. It is also expected that this study can contribute to evaluations and/or pre-evaluations of other programs with a similar scope.

24,"How long does it take to translate research findings into routine healthcare practice?-the case of biological drugs for rheumatoid arthritis in Brazil Background: The literature reports long time lags between the several processes involved in the translation of drug research and development into clinical application. To expedite these processes, translational research has emerged as a process that can be applied to reduce the lag between scientific discoveries and their practical application. Thus, the objective of this study was to estimate the time lag in translational research of biological drugs for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis included in the Brazilian Unified Health System [Sistema Unico de Saude (SUS)]. Methods: A descriptive retrospective study was conducted based on secondary data loaded by SUS users in public sources and systems to estimate the time lag between the publication of phase I clinical trial results to drug use in clinical settings. The dates of translational research activities were identified from markers and steps. Structured searches were conducted in the literature and reports from the National Commission for the Incorporation of Technologies in the SUS (Conitec) as well as from health authorities, and analyzed. Results: Between 2012 and 2019, SUS included five biological agents for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. The mean time lag from clinical development to use of these agents was 11.13 years (range, 8.57 to 12.90 years). The mean time lag for the stages of translational research were 5.30 (T1-basic research to clinical research), 5.08 (T2-clinical research to research synthesis), and 0.75 (T3-research synthesis to evidence-based practice) years. A shorter time lag was observed in the Brazilian case when it was possible to compare with other studies. Conclusions: The estimated time lag of biological drugs used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis was determined based on the translational research steps model adapted to the Brazilian context. Brazil has instituted legal frameworks that set deadlines for sanitary registration, health technology assessment (HTA), and the availability of drugs in the SUS, thus, allowing for a reduced stage T2 time lag. Nevertheless, improvements are still required in stages T1 and T2, especially in publishing the results of clinical trials.

25,"Back to the Basics: the Dynamic of Infectious Diseases in Context The epidemiology of infectious diseases shares with theoretical and empirical ecology the integrated analysis of the dynamics of different populations of host-pathogens or preys-predators-parasites in context, i.e. as part of a vast web of interactions, webs with the double character of matter/energy transfer and differential reproductive success. Such dynamics mutually influence each other, but do not map one into each other. After the 1950 and especially after the 1990s, such analyses have been integrated to the analyses of phenomena taking place at the micro-level, including the dynamics of genomic and post-genomic structures and networks. As discussed at length in the present paper, reductionist perspectives in the fields of both molecular and evolutionary biology were instrumental to the progress of such disciplines in the 1960s and have contributed to the understanding of many simple phenomena. Notwithstanding, major progress had taken place in the fields of molecular biology, biomathematics and computation, making such oversimplified models not only misleading in terms of a proper understanding of biology, but detrimental to the assessment and analysis of complex phenomena, such as the dynamics of cancer or the emergence and transmission of resistant strains in environments under anthropic pressure. Alternative views do exist, at least since the late 1980s, as advanced by authors such as David Hull and, more recently, Eva Jablonka and coworkers, among others, and should be fully explored in order to move beyond the strictly gene-centered paradigm. The so-called “beans bag genetics” is not only no longer necessary, but has been hindering the progress of evolutionary biology, epidemiology and molecular biology itself. Despite the enormous popularity of such oversimplified perspectives among the lay audience, those working in the forefront of biology should try to be as precise in their empirical work as sound in the use of concepts and design of comprehensive research programs.

26,"Nanoformulations with Leishmania braziliensis Antigens Triggered Controlled Parasite Burden in Vaccinated Golden Hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) against Visceral Leishmaniasis Leishmaniasis is a widespread vector-borne disease in Brazil, with Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum as the primary etiological agent of visceral leishmaniasis (VL). Dogs are considered the main reservoir of this parasite, whose treatment in Brazil is restricted to the use of veterinary medicines, which do not promote a parasitological cure. Therefore, efficient vaccine development is the best approach to Canine Visceral Leishmaniasis (CVL) control. With this in mind, this study used hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) as an experimental model in an anti-Leishmania preclinical vaccine trial to evaluate the safety, antigenicity, humoral response, and effects on tissue parasite load. Two novel formulations of nanoparticles made from poly(D, L-lactic) acid (PLA) polymer loading Leishmania braziliensis crude antigen (LB) exhibiting two different particle sizes were utilized: LBPSmG (570 nm) and LBPSmP (388 nm). The results showed that the nanoparticles were safe and harmless to hamsters and were antigenic with the induction in LBSap, LBPSmG, and LBPSmG groups of total anti-Leishmania IgG antibodies 30 days after challenge, which persists 200 days in LBSap and LBPSmP. At the same time, a less pronounced hepatosplenomegaly in LBSap, LBPSmG, and LBPSmP was found when compared to control groups, as well as a less pronounced inflammatory infiltrate and granuloma formation in the spleen. Furthermore, significant reductions of 84%, 81%, and 90% were observed in spleen parasite burden accessed by qPCR in the LBSap, LBPSmG, and LBPSmP groups, respectively. In this way, LBSap, LBPSmG, and LBPSmP formulations showed better results in vaccinated and L. infantum-challenged animals in further reducing parasitic load in the spleen and attenuating lesions in liver and splenic tissues. This results in safe, harmless nanoformulation vaccines with significant immunogenic and infection control potential. In addition, animals vaccinated with LBPSmP had an overall reduction in parasite burden in the spleen, indicating that a smaller nanoparticle could be more efficient in targeting antigen-presenting cells.

27,"New records of the occurrence of biting midges (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) species in rural area of Santa Maria, Rio Grande do Sul, in the South of Brazil Ceratopogonidae (biting midges) species are of medical and veterinary importance and play a role as disease vectors caused by viruses, protozoa, and filarial nematodes. Besides their vectorial importance, they are harmful due to painful bites that cause discomfort in humans and animals. Identifying possible disease vectors is of significant epidemiological importance, therefore, the aim of this study was to carry out a survey of the species of Ceratopogonids that occur in Santa Maria, Rio Grande do Sul, to verify the frequency of occurrence of adults of Ceratopogonidae within one year of capture. Insects were collected weekly (three night a week) using a Captor (R) suction light trap, from March 2020 to March 2021, between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m. Collections of biting midges were separated from other insects, divided into genera and morphologically identified at the species level. A total of 16,054 specimens (71.55% female to 28.44% male) of Ceratopogonidae, were collected and identified, comprising thirteen species. Data presented show that several species of biting midges, including seven new records, have variable frequency and occur year-round at the study site, with the highest number in the warm season. The dominant species were Culicoides insignis and Culicoides venezuelensis.

29,"CLEC5A expression can be triggered by spike glycoprotein and may be a potential target for COVID-19 therapy The immune response is crucial for coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) progression, with the participation of proinflammatory cells and cytokines, inducing lung injury and loss of respiratory function. CLEC5A expression on monocytes can be triggered by viral and bacterial infections, leading to poor outcomes. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is able to induce neutrophil activation by CLEC5A and Toll-like receptor 2, leading to an aggressive inflammatory cascade, but little is known about the molecular interactions between CLEC5A and SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Here, we aimed to explore how CLEC5A expression could be affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection using immunological tools with in vitro, in vivo, and in silico assays. The findings revealed that high levels of CLEC5A expression were found in monocytes from severe COVID-19 patients in comparison with mild COVID-19 and unexposed subjects, but not in vaccinated subjects who developed mild COVID-19. In hamsters, we detected CLEC5A gene expression during 3-15 days of Omicron strain viral challenge. Our results also showed that CLEC5A can interact with SARS-CoV-2, promoting inflammatory cytokine production, probably through an interaction with the receptor-binding domain in the N-acetylglucosamine binding site (NAG-601). The high expression of CLEC5A and high levels of proinflammatory cytokine production were reduced in vitro by a human CLEC5A monoclonal antibody. Finally, CLEC5A was triggered by spike glycoprotein, suggesting its involvement in COVID-19 progression; therapy with a monoclonal antibody could be a good strategy for COVID-19 treatment, but vaccines are still the best option to avoid hospitalization/deaths.

30,"Caryocar coriaceum Wittm. fruit extracts as Leishmania inhibitors: in-vitro and in-silico approaches Leishmaniasis is a group of neglected diseases caused by parasites of the Leishmania genus. The treatment of Leishmaniasis represents a great challenge, because the available drugs present high toxicity and none of them is fully effective. Caryocar is a botanical genus rich in phenolic compounds, which leaves extracts have already been described by its antileishmanial action. Thus, we investigated the effect of pulp and peel extracts of the Caryocar coriaceum fruit on promastigote and amastigote forms of Leishmania amazonensis. Both extracts had antipromastigote effect after 24, 48, and 72 h, and this effect was by apoptosis-like process induction, with reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, damage to the mitochondria and plasma membrane, and phosphatidylserine exposure. Knowing that the fruit extracts did not alter the viability of macrophages, we observed that the treatment reduced the infection of these cells. Thereafter, in the in vitro infection context, the extracts showed antioxidant proprieties, by reducing NO, ROS, and MDA levels. Besides, both peel and pulp extracts up-regulated Nrf2/HO-1/Ferritin expression and increase the total iron-bound in infected macrophages, which culminates in a depletion of available iron for L. amazonensis replication. In silico, the molecular modeling experiments showed that the three flavonoids presented in the C. coriaceum extracts can act as synergistic inhibitors of Leishmania proteins, and compete for the active site. Also, there is a preference for rutin at the active site due to its greater interaction binding strength. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

31,"A post-Flexner comparative case study of medical training responses to health system needs in Brazil and Germany Health systems need medical professionals who can and will work in outpatient settings, such as general practitioner practices or health centres. However, medical students complete only a small portion of their medical training there. Furthermore, this type of training is sometimes seen as inferior to training in academic medical centres and university hospitals. Hence, the healthcare system's demand and the execution of medical curricula do not match. Robust concepts for better alignment of both these parts are lacking. This study aims to (1) describe decentral learning environments in the context of traditional medical curricula and (2) derive ideas for implementing such scenarios further in existing curricula in response to particular medicosocietal needs. This study is designed as qualitative cross-national comparative education research. It comprises three steps: first, two author teams consisting of course managers from Brazil and Germany write a report on change management efforts in their respective faculty. Both teams then compare and comment on the other's report. Emerging similarities and discrepancies are categorised. Third, a cross-national analysis is conducted on the category system. Stakeholders of medical education (medical students, teaching faculty, teachers in decentral learning environments) have differing standards, ideals and goals that are influenced by their own socialisation-prominently, Flexner's view of university hospital training as optimal training. We reiterate that both central and decentral learning environments provide meaningful complementary learning opportunities. Medical students must be prepared to navigate social aspects of learning and accept responsibility for communities. They are uniquely positioned to serve as visionaries and university ambassadors to communities. As such, they can bridge the gap between university hospitals and decentral learning environments. health education and promotion,health services research,health systems,qualitative study BMJ",Ciências da Saúde,Saúde Coletiva,Epidemiologia,Ciências da Saúde,Medicina,Clínica Médica

In contrast, the regulatory mechanisms and fitness consequences of biological rhythms exhibited by parasites remain mysterious. Here, we explore how periodicity in parasite traits is generated and why daily rhythms matter for parasite fitness. We focus on malaria (Plasmodium) parasites which exhibit developmental rhythms during replication in the mammalian host's blood and in transmission to vectors. Rhythmic in-host parasite replication is responsible for elicit' g inflammatory responses, the severity of disease symptoms, and fueling transmission, as well as conferring tolerance to anti-parasite drugs.

33,"Cell-derived microvesicles in infective endocarditis: Role in diagnosis and potential for risk stratification at hospital admission Objectives: To characterize the plasmatic profile of cell-derived microvesicles (MVs) at diagnosis and during the treatment of patients with infective endocarditis (IE). Methods: Blood samples from 57 patients with IE were obtained on 3 consecutive moments: upon admission (T0), at 2 weeks (T1), and at the end of treatment (T2), and were compared with 22 patients with other bacterial infections. MPs were measured by flow cytometry and labeled for specific cell markers of CD45 (leukocytes), CD66b (neutrophils), CD14 (monocytes), CD41a (platelets), CD51 (endothelial cells), CD3 (T lymphocyte) and CD235a (erythrocytes). Results: MVs from platelets (pltMVs), leukocytes (leukMVs), neutrophils (neutMVs), monocytes (monoMVs) and lymphocytes (lymphMVs) were significantly more elevated in the patients with IE, compared to the patients with other bacterial infections, despite comparable age, sex, blood counts and Creactive protein levels. MVs values revealed a relatively stable pattern over time in IE, except for a significant increase in leukMVs and neutMVs in T1. LeukMVs (p =0.011), neutMVs (p =0.010), monoMVs (p =0.016) and lymphMVs (p = 0.020), measured at admission, were significantly higher in IE patients that died during hospitalization in comparison with those that survived. In a multivariable analyses, the levels of neutMVs remained as an independent factor associated with mortality (odds ratio 2.203; 95% confidence interval 1.217 - 3.988; p = 0.009), adjustment for heart failure during the treatment. Conclusions: Plasma levels of pltMVs, leukMVs, neutMVs, monoMVs and lymphMVs were significantly more elevated in patients with IE than in patients with other bacterial infections at hospital admission. Furthermore, neutMVs at admission have been identified as an independent predictor of mortality in patients with IE. Thus, cell derived MPs may become an important tool in the differential diagnosis and mortality risk assessment early in the course of IE suspected cases. (C) 2019 The British Infection Association.

35,"Evaluating the Causal Link Between Malaria Infection and Endemic Burkitt Lymphoma in Northern Uganda: A Mendelian Randomization Study Background: Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) malaria infection is suspected to cause endemic Burkitt Lymphoma (eBL), but the evidence remains unsettled. An inverse relationship between sickle cell trait (SCT) and eBL, which supports that between malaria and eBL, has been reported before, but in small studies with low power. We investigated this hypothesis in children in a population-based study in northern Uganda using Mendelian Randomization. Methods: Malaria-related polymorphisms (SCT, IL10, IL1A, CD36, SEMA3C, and IFNAR1) were genotyped in 202 eBL cases and 624 controls enrolled during 2010-2015. We modeled associations between genotypes and eBL or malaria using logistic regression. Findings: SCT was associated with decreased risk of eBL (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.37, 95% CI 0.21-0.66; p = 0.0003). Decreased risk of eBL was associated with IL10 rs1800896-CT (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.50-1.07) and -CC genotypes (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.29-0.95, p(trend) = 0.019); IL1A rs2856838-AG (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.39-0.81) and -AA genotype (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.28-1.01, p(trend) = 0.0016); and SEMA3C rs4461841-CT or -CC genotypes (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.35-0.93, p = 0.0193). SCT and IL10 rs1800896, IL1A rs2856838, but not SEMA3C rs4461841, polymorphisms were associated with decreased risk of malaria in the controls.

36,"EPIDEMIOLOGICAL PROFILE OF CHILDREN INFECTED BY THE NEW CORONAVIRUS: CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY Objective: to describe the epidemiological profile of children infected by the new coronavirus from the notifications of cases to the Ministry of Health. Method: epidemiological, cross-sectional, and descriptive study, carried out through the notifications in the Epidemiological Surveillance Information System of Influenza from the first to the twentieth epidemiological week of 2021. Notifications from children aged zero to nine years were included. Variables were analyzed using bivariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression. Results: 3,041 cases were notified, among which 414 (13.6%) confirmed the diagnosis of COVID-19. Children between six and nine years old were 1.33 times more likely to develop COVID-19 and be admitted to the intensive care unit (CR=1.46; CI: 1.12-1.87) and had a greater chance (CR=3.30; CI: 1.92-5.66) of dying. Conclusion: the findings contribute to guide and modulate interventions aimed at mitigating transmission and control of aggravations about COVID-19 in children. © 2022, Universidade Federal do Parana.

37,"The occurrence of histoplasmosis in Brazil: A systematic review Background: Histoplasmosis is a systemic disease caused by the dimorphic fungus Histoplasma capsulatum. Diagnosis is often delayed, or it is misdiagnosed as tuberculosis. In Brazil, the infection is common and cases of histoplasmosis have been described in all regions of the country; however, the real problem is underestimated since notification of histoplasmosis is not mandatory. Methods: Human histoplasmosis cases diagnosed in Brazil and published up to December 2018 were identified through a search conducted in the PubMed/MEDLINE, SciELO, and Web of Science databases. Moreover, the isolation of H. capsulatum from animals or environmental sources in Brazil was also evaluated. Results: A total of 207 articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were evaluated, involving a total of 3530 patients with a diagnosis of histoplasmosis during the period studied. Of these patients, 78.3% were male, giving a male-to-female ratio of approximately 4:1. Histoplasmosis presented a higher frequency in individuals between the fourth and fifth decades of life. Disseminated disease was the most common form of histoplasmosis. Isolation of H. capsulatum on culture media and histopathology using staining methods were the diagnostic methods with the best efficiency. The best results in the identification of the H. capsulatum were achieved for samples from mononuclear phagocyte system components, skin and mucosa, and hematological samples. Regarding predisposing factors for histoplasmosis, HIV infection was the most common underlying condition. The overall mortality rate was 33.1%. Conclusions: This study represents the first available systematic review demonstrating Brazilian cases of histoplasmosis in the literature and highlights that the disease is more widespread in the Brazilian territory than has previously been thought.

38,"Socioeconomic Inequalities in the Quality of Primary Care under Brazil?s National Pay-forperformance Programme: a Longitudinal Study of Family Health Teams Background Many governments have introduced pay-for-performance programmes to incentivise health providers to improve quality of care. Evidence on whether these programmes reduce or exacerbate disparities in health care is scarce. In this study, we aimed to assess socioeconomic inequalities in the performance of family health teams under Brazil's National Programme for Improving Primary Care Access and Quality (PMAQ). Methods For this longitudinal study, we analysed data on the quality of care delivered by family health teams participating in PMAQ over three rounds of implementation: round 1 (November, 2011, to March, 2013), round 2 (April, 2013, to September, 2015), and round 3 (October, 2015, to December, 2019). The primary outcome was the percentage of the maximum performance score obtainable by family health teams (the PMAQ score), based on several hundred (ranging from 598 to 914) indicators of health-care delivery. Using census data on household income of local areas, we examined the PMAQ score by income ventile. We used ordinary least squares regressions to examine the association between PMAQ scores and the income of each local area across implementation rounds, and we did an analysis of variance to assess geographical variation in PMAQ score. Findings Of the 40 361 family health teams that were registered as ever participating in PMAQ, we included 13 934 teams that participated in the three rounds of PMAQ in our analysis. These teams were located in 11 472 census areas and served approximately 48 million people. The mean PMAQ score was 61.0% (median 61.8, IQR 55.3-67.9) in round 1, 55.3% (median 56.0, IQR 47.6-63.4) in round 2, and 61.6% (median 62.7, IQR 54.4-69.9) in round 3. In round 1, we observed a positive socioeconomic gradient, with the mean PMAQ score ranging from 56.6% in the poorest group to 64.1% in the richest group. Between rounds 1 and 3, mean PMAQ performance increased by 7.1 percentage points for the poorest group and decreased by 0.8 percentage points for the richest group (p<0.0001), with the gap between richest and poorest narrowing from 7.5 percentage points (95% CI 6.5 to 8.5) to -0.4 percentage points over the same period (-1.6 to 0.8). Interpretation Existing income inequalities in the delivery of primary health care were eliminated during the three rounds of PMAQ, plausibly due to a design feature of PMAQ that adjusted financial payments for socioeconomic inequalities. However, there remains an important policy agenda in Brazil to address the large inequities in health. Copyright (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

39,"Entomological Surveillance of Aedes Mosquitoes: Comparison of Different Collection Methods in an Endemic Area in RIO de Janeiro, Brazil Using collection methods for Aedes adults as surveillance tools provides reliable indices and arbovirus detection possibilities. This study compared the effectiveness of different methods for collecting Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus and detecting arboviruses circulating in field-caught female specimens. Collection sites were defined in urban, peri-urban, and rural landscapes in two Brazilian cities. Collections were performed using Adultraps (ADT), BG-Sentinel (BGS), CDC-like traps (CDC), and indoor (ASP-I) and outdoor (ASP-O) aspiration during the rainy and dry seasons of 2015 and 2016. Generalized linear mixed models were used to model the effectiveness of each collection method. A total of 434 Ae. aegypti and 393 Ae. albopictus were collected. In total, 64 Ae. aegypti and sixteen Ae. albopictus female pools were tested for DENV, CHIKV, ZIKV, or YFV; none were positive. Positivity and density were linear at low densities (<1 specimen); thereafter, the relationship became non-linear. For Ae. aegypti, ADT and CDC were less effective, and ASP-I and ASP-O were as effective as BGS. For Ae. albopictus, all collection methods were less effective than BGS. This study highlights the need for an integrated surveillance method as an effective tool for monitoring Aedes vectors. mosquito vectors,Aedes,entomological surveillance,trap comparison,adultrap,BG-Sentinel,CDC light trap,backpack aspiration TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE",Ciências Biológicas,Ecologia,Ecologia Aplicada,Ciências Biológicas,Zoologia,Zoologia Aplicada
40,"Early mortality in a cohort of people living with HIV in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 2004-2015: a persisting problem Background Global mortality from AIDS-related diseases has been declining since 2005, resulting primarily from the widespread use and early initiation of combination antiretroviral therapy. Despite the significant improvements, high rates of early mortality, usually defined as that occurring within the 1st year of entry to care, have been observed, especially in resource-limited settings. This analysis draws upon data from an observational cohort of people with HIV (PWH) followed at a reference center for HIV/AIDS care and research in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to identify the pattern and factors associated with early mortality. Methods The study population includes PWH aged 18 or older followed at the National Institute of Infectious Diseases Evandro Chagas who were enrolled between 2004 and 2015. The primary outcome was early mortality, defined as deaths occurring within 1 year of inclusion in the cohort, considering two follow-up periods: 0 to 90 days (very early mortality) and 91 to 365 days (early mortality). Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify the variables associated with the hazard of very early and early mortality. Results Overall, 3879 participants contributed with 3616.4 person-years of follow-up. Of 220 deaths, 132 happened in the first 90 days and 88 between 91 and 365 days. Very early mortality rate ratios (MRR) show no statistically significant temporal differences between the periods 2004-2006 to 2013-2015. In contrast, for early mortality, a statistically significant decreasing trend was observed: mortality rates in the periods 2004-2006 (MR = 5.5; 95% CI 3.9-7.8) and 2007-2009 (MR = 3.9; 95% CI 2.7-5.7) were approximately four and three-fold higher when compared to 2013-2015 (MR = 1.4; 95% CI 0.7-2.7). Low CD4 count and prior AIDS-defining illness were strongly associated with higher hazard ratios of death, especially when considering very early mortality. Conclusions The present study shows an excess of mortality in the 1st year of follow-up with no changes in the mortality rates within 90 days among PWH from Rio de Janeiro. We note the significant impact of initiating treatment with immunosuppression, as evidenced by the increased risk of death among those with low CD4 cell count and with AIDS-defining illnesses.

These heterocyclic derivatives were structurally planned by exploring the concept of molecular hybridisation between two arylhydrazones derived from megazol, which has potent trypanocidal activity. The trypanocidal activity of these triarylimidazole derivatives was evaluated against infective trypomastigote forms of T. cruzi and the derivative 2'-(4-bromophenyl)-1-methyl-5'-phenyl-1H,3'H-2,4'-biimidazol- 3'-ol showed moderate biological activity (IC50 = 23.9 μM) when compared to benznidazole, a standard trypanocidal drug. These compounds did not present cytotoxic effects at concentrations near the trypanocidal IC50, being considered a good starting point for the development of new anti-Chagas drug candidates. 2,4,5-triaryl-N-hydroxyimidazole; Chagas disease; Trypanocidal activity; Trypanosoma cruzi Molecules",Ciências Exatas e da Terra,Química,Química Orgânica,Ciências da Saúde,Farmácia,Análise e Controle e Medicamentos

44,"The effect of Ageratum fastigiatum extract on Rhodnius nasutus, vector of Chagas disease Control of Chagas disease is based on insecticide spraying in domiciles in order to exterminate triatomine populations. However, since the vectors differ in susceptibility to currently used insecticides, the screening of the toxic potential of Brazilian flora may identify new molecules lethal to triatomines. This study evaluated the toxicity of ethanolic extract of Ageratum fastigiatum (Gardner) R.M. King & H. Rob., Asteraceae, on Rhodnius nasutus, a known vector of Chagas disease. Ethanolic extracts of the aerial parts of A. fastigiatum were prepared at 25 and 50 mg/mL concentrations, and 5 mu L was applied to fifth-instar nymphs of R. nasutus (n=30). Controls included nymphs that were treated with 5 mu L ethanol (n=30) or left untreated (n=30). The percentage of dead insects in each group was observed at 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 h after application. The extracts of A. fastigiatum showed a mortality rate of about 37% and 77% after 120 h, at concentrations of 25 and 50 mg/mL, respectively. In control groups, the mortality rate remained under 7%.

45,"Chitinosanase: A fungal chitosan hydrolyzing enzyme with a new and unusually specific cleavage pattern The biological activities of partially acetylated chitosan oligosaccharides (paCOS) depend on their degree of polymerization (DP), fraction of acetylation (F-A), and potentially their pattern of acetylation (P-A). Therefore, analyzing structure-function relationships require fully defined paCOS, but these are currently unavailable. A promising approach for obtaining at least partially defined paCOS is using chitosanolytic enzymes. Here we purified and characterized a novel chitosan-hydrolyzing enzyme from the fungus Alternaria alternata possessing an absolute cleavage specificity, yielding fully defined paCOS. It cleaves specifically after GlcN-GlcNAc pairs and is most active towards moderately acetylated chitosans, but shows no activity against fully acetylated or fully deacetylated substrates. These unique properties match neither those of chitinases nor chitosanases. Therefore, the enzyme represents the first member of a new class of chitosanolytic enzymes that will allow for the production of fully defined paCOS. Additionally, it represents a highly valuable tool for fingerprinting analyses of chitosan polymers. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

46,"Hormonal and Psychogenic Risk Factors for Erectile Dysfunction in Men with HTLV-1 Introduction: Erectile dysfunction (ED) is associated with neurological damage due to human T-lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV-1) infection, but hormonal and psychogenic factors also cause ED. Aim: To evaluate the association of psychogenic and hormonal factors with ED in men infected with HTLV-1. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, we compared total testosterone, follicle stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, prolactin, anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, and neurologic manifestations in HTLV-1-infected men with or without ED. The International Index of Erectile Function was used to determine the degree of ED. Participants were grouped according to Osame's Motor Disability Scale and the Expanded Disability Status Scale: HTLV-1-associated myelopathy or tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), probable HAM/TSP, or HTLV-1 carrier. Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests were used to compare the groups, and regression analyses were used to show predictors of ED. Main Outcome Measure: Sexual hormonal levels, psychogenic factors, and neurologic disabilities were found to be associated with ED. Results: ED was associated with age older than 60 years (P < .001), degree of neurologic involvement (P < .001), depression (P = .009), and anxiety (P = .008). In the multivariate analyses, only age and degree of neurological injury remained as risk factors for ED. Clinical Implications: Neurological manifestations are a stronger predictor of ED than hormonal and psychogenic factors in HTLV-1-infected men. Strengths & Limitations: The statistical power of the study was limited due to the low number of participants, but neurologic manifestations were clearly associated with ED. There was no strong association between hormonal and psychogenic factors and ED. Conclusion: Hormonal and psychogenic factors did not show a strong association with ED in individuals with HTLV-1, but neurological manifestations were strongly associated with ED in these individuals.

50,"Absence of CCR5 increases neutrophil recruitment in severe herpetic encephalitis Background: The neuroinflammatory response aimed at clearance of herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) plays a key role in the pathogenesis of neuroaxonal damage in herpetic encephalitis. Leukocytes activated in an adaptive immune response access brain tissue by passing through the blood-brain barrier. The chemokine CCL5/RANTES is involved in recruitment of these cells to the brain acting via the receptors CCR1, CCR3 and mainly CCR5. Here, we evaluated the role of CCR5 on traffic of leukocytes in the brain microvasculature, cellular and cytokines profile in a severe form of herpetic encephalitis. Results: Wild type and mice lacking CCR5 (CCR5(-/-)) were inoculated intracerebrally with 10(4) PFU of neurotropic HSV-1. We evaluated the traffic of leukocytes in the brain microvasculature using intravital microscopy and the profile of cytokines by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay at 1 day post infection. Flow cytometry and histopathological analyses were also carried out in brain tissue. Absence of CCR5 leads to lower viral load and an increased leukocyte adhesion in brain microvasculature, predominantly of neutrophils (CD11(+) Ly6G(+) cells). Moreover, there was a significant increase in the levels of MIP-1/CCL2, RANTES/CCL5, KC/CXCL1 and MIG/CXCL9 in the brain of infected CCR5(-/-) mice. Conclusions: These results suggest that the absence of CCR5 may boost the immune response with a high neutrophil recruitment which most likely helps in viral clearance.

Conclusions: These results suggest that the absence of CCR5 may boost the immune response with a high neutrophil recruitment which most likely helps in viral clearance. Nonetheless, the elevated immune response may be detrimental to the host.

51,"Interactions with apoptotic but not with necrotic neutrophils increase parasite burden in human macrophages infected with Leishmania amazonensis Neutrophils are involved in the initial steps of most responses to pathogens. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of the interaction of apoptotic vs. necrotic human neutrophils on macrophage infection by Leishmania amazonensis. Phagocytosis of apoptotic, but not viable, neutrophils by Leishmania-infected macrophages led to an increase in parasite burden via a mechanism dependent on TGF-beta 1 and PGE(2). Conversely, infected macrophages' uptake of necrotic neutrophils induced killing of L. amazonensis. Leishmanicidal activity was dependent on TNF-alpha and neutrophilic elastase. Nitric oxide was not involved in the killing of parasites, but the interaction of necrotic neutrophils with infected macrophages resulted in high superoxide production, a process reversed by catalase, an inhibitor of reactive oxygen intermediate production. Initial events after Leishmania infection involve interactions with neutrophils; we demonstrate that phagocytosis of these cells in an apoptotic or necrotic stage can influence the outcome of infection, driving either parasite survival or destruction. apoptosis,necrosis,phagocytosis,TGF-beta 1,NE Journal of Leukocyte Biology",Ciências Biológicas,Parasitologia,Protozoologia de Parasitos,Ciências Biológicas,Parasitologia,Protozoologia de Parasitos

53,"The utility of anti-trypomastigote lytic antibodies for determining cure of Trypanosoma cruzi infections in treated patients: an overview and perspectives In previous work, we proposed alternative protocols for following patients with treated Chagas disease and these are reviewed herein. Evidence was provided to support the following: (i) functional anti-trypomastigote antibodies are indicative of ongoing chronic Trypanosoma cruzi infections; (ii) specific antibodies detected by conventional serology (CS) with epimastigote extracts, fixed trypomastigotes or other parasite antigens may circulate years after parasite elimination; (iii) functional antibodies are evidenced by complement-mediated lysis of freshly isolated trypomastigotes, a test which is 100% specific, highly sensitive, and the first to revert after T. cruzi elimination and (iv) the parasite target for the lytic antibodies is a glycoprotein of high molecular weight (gp160) anchored at the parasite surface. The complement regulatory protein has been cloned, sequenced and produced as a recombinant protein by other groups and is useful for identifying functional anti-T. cruzi antibodies in ELISA tests, thus dispensing with the need for live trypomastigotes to manage treated patients. If used instead of CS to define cures for Chagas patients, ELISA will avoid unnecessary delays in finding anti-T. cruzi drugs.

On account of their large diversity, globins from mollusks have contributed to the study of this protein class. The cDNA of the myoglobins from Biomphalaria straminea and Biomphalaria tenagophila, which have a glutamine as distal residue (E7), were constructed and analyzed by bioinformatic tools. Native (not recombinant) myoglobins of these two Biomphalaria species were purified and their experimental molecular mass (about 16 kDa) and pI (about (8.0) were provided. Data analysis showed that these proteins are monomers with the signature for the classic myoglobin fold and they are blocked in amino terminus probably by an acetyl group. Values of the autoxidation rates showed that these myoglobins oxidized slowly.

56,"Prediction of esophageal varices by liver stiffness and platelets in persons with human immunodeficiency virus infection and compensated advanced chronic liver disease Background. People living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLWH) are at increased risk of cirrhosis and esophageal varices. Baveno VI criteria, based on liver stiffness measurement (LSM) and platelet count, have been proposed to avoid unnecessary esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) screening for esophageal varices needing treatment (EVNT). This approach has not been validated in PLWH. Methods. PLWH from 8 prospective cohorts were included if they fulfilled the following criteria: (1) compensated advanced chronic liver disease (LSM >10 kPa); (2) availability of EGD within 6 months of reliable LSM. Baveno VI (LSM <20 kPa and platelets >150 000/μL), expanded Baveno VI (LSM <25 kPa and platelets >110 000/μL), and Estudio de las Hepatitis Víricas (HEPAVIR) criteria (LSM <21 kPa) were applied to identify patients not requiring EGD screening. Criteria optimization was based on the percentage of EGDs spared, while keeping the risk of missing EVNT <5%. Results. Five hundred seven PLWH were divided into a training (n = 318) and a validation set (n = 189). EVNT were found in 7.5%. In the training set, Baveno VI, expanded Baveno VI, and HEPAVIR criteria spared 10.1%, 25.5%, and 28% of EGDs, while missing 0%, 1.2%, and 2.2% of EVNT, respectively. The best thresholds to rule out EVNT were platelets >110 000/μL and LSM <30 kPa (HIV cirrhosis criteria), with 34.6% of EGDs spared and 0% EVNT missed. In the validation set, HEPAVIR and HIV cirrhosis criteria spared 54% and 48.7% of EGDs, while missing 4.9% and 2.2% EVNT, respectively. Conclusions. Baveno VI criteria can be extended to HEPAVIR and HIV cirrhosis criteria while sparing a significant number of EGDs, thus improving resource utilization for PLWH with compensated advanced chronic liver disease. © The Author(s) 2019.

57,"Genetic diversity of Leishmania infantum field populations from Brazil Leishmania infantum (syn. Leishmania chagasi) is the etiological agent of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in Brazil. The epidemiology of VL is poorly understood. Therefore, a more detailed molecular characterization at an intraspecific level is certainly needed. Herein, three independent molecular methods, multilocus microsatellite typing (MLMT), random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and simple sequence repeats-polymerase chain reaction (SSR-PCR), were used to evaluate the genetic diversity of 53 L. infantum isolates from five different endemic areas in Brazil. Population structures were inferred by distance-based and Bayesian-based approaches. Eighteen very similar genotypes were detected by MLMT, most of them differed in only one locus and no correlation was found between MLMT profiles, geographical origin or the estimated population structure. However, complex profiles composed of 182 bands obtained by both RAPD and SSR-PCR assays gave different results. Unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean trees built from these data revealed a high degree of homogeneity within isolates of L. infantum.

59,"Leishmanicidal compounds of Nectria pseudotrichia, an endophytic fungus isolated from the plant Caesalpinia echinata (Brazilwood) BACKGROUND In a screen of extracts from plants and fungi to detect antileishmanial activity, we found that the ethyl acetate extract of the fungus Nectria pseudotrichia, isolated from the tree Caesalpinia echinata (Brazilwood), is a promising source of bioactive compounds. OBJECTIVES The aims of this study were to isolate and determine the chemical structures of the compounds responsible for the antileishmanial activity of the organic extract from N. pseudotrichia. METHODS Compounds were isolated by chromatographic fractionation using semi-preparative high-performance liquid chromatography, and their chemical structures were determined by analytical and spectral data and by comparison with published data. The antileishmanial activity of the isolated compounds was evaluated in intracellular amastigote forms of Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis expressing firefly luciferase as reporter gene, and cytotoxicity was determined in Vero and THP-1 mammalian cell lines by MTT assay. FINDINGS Fractionation of the extract yielded seven compounds: 10-acetyl trichoderonic acid A (1), 6'-acetoxy-piliformic acid (2), 5',6'-dehydropiliformic acid (3), piliformic acid (4), hydroheptelidic acid (5), xylaric acid D (6), and cytochalasin D (7).

60,"Effectiveness of Direct-acting Agents After Liver Transplantation and Regression of Biomarkers Post-HCV Treatment: A Real-life Study in Rio de Janeiro Background: Data concerning hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment using direct-acting agents (DAAs) post liver transplantation (LT) remains scarce in low- and average-income countries. Aim of the study: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of post-LT HCV treatment using DAAs in Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), and to assess the course of hepatic biomarkers after sustained virological response (SVR). Methods: Data from LT recipients with recurrent HCV treated using DAAs was retrospectively analyzed. HCV was defined by detectable HCV-RNA with elevated aminotransferases and/or histological signs of infection on liver biopsy post LT. SVR was defined as undetectable HCV-RNA 12 weeks after the end of treatment. Aspartate-to-Platelet Ratio Index (APRI) and Fibrosis-4 score (FIB-4) were calculated before treatment and after SVR. Results: 116 patients (63% male, median age 62 years, 75% genotype 1 and 62% with hepatocellular carcinoma [HCC] prior to LT) were included. Cirrhosis was identified in the allograft of 21 subjects (18%). The overall SVR was 96.6% without differences in SVR proportion according to clinical/demographic characteristics, genotype or presence of cirrhosis. SVR rates were similar in individuals with and without HCC pre-LT (95.8% [95% CI: 87.6–98.7] vs. 97.7% [95% CI: 85.0–99.7%], p = 0.588). No serious adverse events were observed and the use of ribavirin was associated with at least one adverse event (OR = 8.71 [95% CI: 3.17–23.99]). SVR was associated with regression of APRI (OR = 26.00 [95% CI 4.27–1065.94]) and FIB-4 (OR = 15.00 [95% CI: 2.30–631.47]). Conclusion: Post-LT HCV treatment with DAAs was safe and effective and associated with a significant decrease in hepatic biomarker levels after SVR. © 2022 Direct Acting Agents, Hepatitis C virus, Liver Transplantation, Non-Invasive Methods Archives of Medical Research",Ciências da Saúde,Medicina,Clínica Médica,Ciências da Saúde,Medicina,Clínica Médica

62,"Neurological Findings in Children without Congenital Microcephaly Exposed to Zika Virus in Utero: A Case Series Study The Zika virus can induce a disruptive sequence in the fetal brain and is manifested mainly by microcephaly. Knowledge gaps still exist as to whether the virus can cause minor disorders that are perceived later on during the first years of life in children who are exposed but are asymptomatic at birth. In this case series, we describe the outcomes related to neurodevelopment through the neurological assessment of 26 non-microcephalic children who had intrauterine exposure to Zika virus. Children were submitted for neurological examinations and Bayley Scales-III (cognition, language, and motor performance). The majority (65.4%) obtained satisfactory performance in neurodevelopment. The most impaired domain was language, with 30.7% impairment. Severe neurological disorders occurred in five children (19.2%) and these were spastic hemiparesis, epilepsy associated with congenital macrocephaly (Zika and human immunodeficiency virus), two cases of autism (one exposed to Zika and Toxoplasma gondii) and progressive sensorineural hearing loss (GJB2 mutation). We concluded that non-microcephalic children with intrauterine exposure to Zika virus, in their majority, had achieved satisfactory performance in all neurodevelopmental domains. One third of the cases had some impairment, but the predominant group had mild alterations, with low occurrence of moderate to severe disorders, similar to other studies in Brazil. arbovirus,Zika virus,infant health,congenital Zika syndrome,coinfection,neurodevelopment,Bayley III,neurologic manifestations,autism,non-microcephalic children Viruses-basel",Ciências Biológicas,Parasitologia,Entomologia e Malacologia de Parasitos e Vetores,Ciências da Saúde,Medicina,Saúde Materno-Infantil

OBJECTIVES To define the immunologic biomarkers that correlate with acute ZIKV infection. METHODS We characterized the levels of circulating cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors in 54 infected patients of both genders at five different time points after symptom onset using microbeads multiplex immunoassay; comparison to 100 age-matched controls was performed for statistical analysis and data mining. FINDINGS ZIKV-infected patients present a striking systemic inflammatory response with high levels of pro-inflammatory mediators. Despite the strong inflammatory pattern, IL-1Ra and IL-4 are also induced during the acute infection. Interestingly, the inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-13, IL-17, TNF-α, and IFN-γ; chemokines CXCL8, CCL2, CCL5; and the growth factor G-CSF, displayed a bimodal distribution accompanying viremia. While this is the first manuscript to document bimodal distributions of viremia in ZIKV infection, this has been documented in other viral infections, with a primary viremia peak during mild systemic disease and a secondary peak associated with distribution of the virus to organs and tissues. MAIN CONCLUSIONS Biomarker network analysis demonstrated distinct dynamics in concurrence with the bimodal viremia profiles at different time points during ZIKV infection. Such a robust cytokine and chemokine response has been associated with blood-brain barrier permeability and neuroinvasiveness in other flaviviral infections.

64,"Decipher Me or I’ll Devour You: Riddles of Health Surveillance in the Covid-19 Pandemic Abstract Since January 2020, the world has been experiencing an unprecedented health crisis, after the World Health Organization declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern as a surveillance strategy and immediate response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In Brazil, the economic and political chaos resulting from the 2016 coup d’état deepened the pandemic crisis, exposing the gap between social inequalities, and especially health inequalities, and the lack of appreciation of life in all its dimensions. This reflection brings to the scene conjunctural elements (economic-political and socio-environmental) necessary to understand technical surveillance interventions, with an emphasis on quarantine and social isolation, as emergency strategies that standardize individual and collective life, used to control bodies and places. In this catastrophic scenario, vulnerable territories are doubly penalized by their peripheral condition in the space of cities and by their systematic exclusion from citizenship rights, demanding from governments interventions that consider the continental dimension and the economic-cultural heterogeneity of the country; social and health inequalities; and the capacity for timely response of each management sphere of the exclusive responsibility of the State, in the field of health surveillance actions, specialized care and basic health care actions in the Unified Health System.

66,"Structure-function relationships of the peptide Paulistine: A novel toxin from the venom of the social wasp Polybia paulista Background: The peptide Paulistine was isolated from the venom of wasp Polybia paulista. This peptide exists under a natural equilibrium between the forms: oxidised with an intra-molecular disulphide bridge; and reduced in which the thiol groups of the cysteine residues do not form the disulphide bridge. The biological activities of both forms of the peptide are unknown up to now. Methods: Both forms of Paulistine were synthesised and the thiol groups of the reduced form were protected with the acetamidemethyl group [Acm-Paulistine] to prevent re-oxidation. The structure/activity relationships of the two forms were investigated, taking into account the importance of the disulphide bridge. Results: Paulistine has a more compact structure, while Acm-Paulistine has a more expanded conformation. Bioassays reported that Paulistine caused hyperalgesia by interacting with the receptors of lipid mediators involved in the cyclooxygenase type II pathway, while Acm-Paullistine also caused hyperalgesia, but mediated by receptors involved in the participation of prostanoids in the cyclooxygenase type II pathway. Conclusion: The acetamidemethylation of the thiol groups of cysteine residues caused small structural changes, which in turn may have affected some physicochemical properties of the Paulistine. Thus, the dissociation of the hyperalgesy from the edematogenic effect when the actions of Paulistine and Acm-Paulistine are compared to each other may be resulting from the influence of the introduction of Acm-group in the structure of Paulistine. General significance: The peptides Paulistine and Acm-Paulistine may be used as interesting tools to investigate the mechanisms of pain and inflammation in future studies. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

67,"Predictive models of newborn body composition: a systematic review Objective: To analyze the prediction models of fat-free mass and fat mass of neonates who had air displacement plethysmography as a reference test. Data source: A systematic review of studies identified in the databases was carried out. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist was used for inclusion of studies, the Transparent Reporting of a Multivariable Prediction Model for Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) report was used to select only predictive models studies, and the Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST) was used to assess the risk of bias in the models. Data synthesis: This study is registered in PROSPERO with identification CRD42020175048. Five hundred and three studies were found during the searches, and only four papers (six models) were eligible. Most studies (three) used the sum of different skinfolds to predict neonatal body fat and all presented weight as the variable with the highest contribution to predicting neonatal body composition. Two models that used skinfolds showed high coefficients of determination and explained, significantly, 81% of the body fat measured by air displacement plethysmography, while the models using bioimpedance did not find a significant correlation between the impedance index and the fat-free mass. Conclusions: The few studies found on this topic had numerous methodological differences. However, the subscapular skinfold was a strong predictor of neonatal body fat in three studies. It is noteworthy that such model validation studies should be carried out in the future, allowing them to be subsequently applied to the population. The development of these models with low-cost tools will contribute to better nutritional monitoring of children and could prevent complications in adulthood.

68,"Molecular Studies of the Brazilian Infectious bronchitis virus isolates Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) isolates have been widely characterized by reverse transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing. In present study, these techniques were applied to three viral genomic regions comprising the complete and/or a partial S1 segment, S2 and nucleocapsid genes. DNA sequences from viral isolates obtained from 1972 to 1989 and from 2006 to 2008 were compared. High similarity (>90%) was observed among some of the genomic segments, including S1 hypervariable region, which could suggest a common origin or ancestry. DNA sequences from S2 and N protein genes obtained from different infected tissues of the same flock were analyzed, and a clear segregation between respiratory and intestinal tract was observed. Therefore, these data suggest co-circulation of more than one viral strain in the same flock. 57.1% of DNA sequences from the S1 complete segment samples, 53.3% from the S2 fragment and 62.5% from the partial N gene were found to be different from analyzed sequences from reference strains leading to the conclusion that parte of viral isolates included in this study may be considered region specific. Considering the simultaneous analysis of the three genes, a large IBV genetic profile was observed in both old and recent isolates groups.

69,"From a lasting illness to a curable disease: the history of research on Yaws in Brazil The author addresses aspects of the history of yaws and its research in Brazil. He presents the controversial debate on the origins of the disease present in medical theses from the 19th century, paying attention to the changes in therapies administered for yaws, which produced different framings throughout the 20th century until the advent of new medications and the definition of penicillin as the method for carrying out the eradication campaign in the 1950s. The tradition of research on yaws at the Oswaldo Cruz Institute (IOC) and the trajectory of physician Felipe Nery Guimarães, responsible for the first tests with penicillin applied to yaws in Brazil, will be fundamental for understanding the path taken until the creation of the campaign.

72,"Inspiratory Muscle Training Improves Aerobic Capacity in Amateur Indoor Football Players Inspiratory muscle training represents a recommended clinical practice to improve physical performance of healthy individuals, athletes, and those with chronic diseases. This study aimed to evaluate whether high- and low-intensity inspiratory muscle training interferes with the aerobic capacity of indoor soccer players. Volunteers were equally and randomly divided into CON (control group, no inspiratory muscle training); HIG (high-intensity group, inspiratory muscle training at 80% of maximal inspiratory pressure, 3 sets of 12 repetitions); and LIG (low-intensity group, inspiratory muscle training at 50% of maximal inspiratory pressure, 2 sets of 20 repetitions). Before and after inspiratory muscle training, maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures, the incremental shuttle run test, and the 3-min step test were evaluated. Both inspiratory muscle training protocols improved maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures, and indirect maximal oxygen consumption and distance traveled in the shuttle test compared to CON. However, only HIG achieved significant increases of indirect oxygen consumption and frequency of step rise in the 3-min step test (p<0.05). Inspiratory muscle training is an important tool to enhance maximal inspiratory pressure and exercise tolerance with potential benefits on submaximal aerobic capacity. However, high-intensity inspiratory muscle training improved aerobic capacity in amateur indoor soccer players in both submaximal tests. inspiratory muscle training,indoor football,aerobic performance,athlete,muscle training protocol INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE",Ciências da Saúde,Saúde Coletiva,Epidemiologia,Ciências da Saúde,Fisioterapia e Terapia Ocupacional,Fisioterapia e Terapia Ocupacional
73,"Imatinib derivatives as inhibitors of K562 cells in chronic myeloid leukemia Imatinib was the first representative of the class of Breakpoint cluster region-Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog (BCR-ABL) tyrosine kinase inhibitors used for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia. Second-generation and third-generation drugs have been introduced in this therapy, affording increased patient survival. However, all BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been shown to induce resistance, necessitating a search for new therapeutic options. The sunitinib, another tyrosine kinase inhibitor used in the treatment of renal cell carcinoma and gastrointestinal stromal tumors is an isatin derivative. Isatin nucleus is highly versatile for the preparation of new substances, and several tyrosine kinase inhibitors examples have been obtained using it. This work aimed to design, synthesize, and biological evaluation of new compounds using the K562 cell line, which constitutively expresses the active BCR-ABL enzyme. Three new series of imatinib derivatives have been planned from the imatinib, and all have a phenylaminopyrimidine group as the main pharmacophore. Sunitinib was used as a structural prototype to planning the series 1 (8a–e) of hybrids between sunitinib and imatinib. Series 2 and 3 are 2-oxo-2-phenyacetamide and 2,2-difluoro-2-phenylacetamide derivatives, respectively. Isatins were used as the starting materials for all series. Compounds were synthesized using simple methodologies and were obtained in high purities. The compounds were tested against K562 cells, and four showed a reduction in cell viability, with EC50 values ranging from 0.37 to 2.02 μM, some of which are close to the imatinib standard (0.21 µM). © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

74,"Lipoxin A 4 attenuates zymosan-induced arthritis by modulating endothelin-1 and its effects BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Lipoxin A 4 (LXA 4) is a lipid mediator involved in the resolution of inflammation. Increased levels of LXA 4 in synovial fluid and enhanced expression of the formyl peptide receptor 2/lipoxin A 4 receptor (FPR2/ALX) in the synovial tissues of rheumatoid arthritis patients have been reported. Endothelins (ETs) play a pivotal pro-inflammatory role in acute articular inflammatory responses. Here, we evaluated the anti-inflammatory role of LXA 4, during the acute phase of zymosan-induced arthritis, focusing on the modulation of ET-1 expression and its effects. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH The anti-inflammatory effects of LXA 4, BML-111 (agonist of FPR2/ALX receptors) and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) pre- and post-treatments were investigated in a murine model of zymosan-induced arthritis. Articular inflammation was assessed by examining knee joint oedema; neutrophil accumulation in synovial cavities; and levels of prepro-ET-1 mRNA, leukotriene (LT)B 4, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α and the chemokine KC/CXCL1, after stimulation. The direct effect of LXA 4 on ET-1-induced neutrophil activation and chemotaxis was evaluated by shape change and Boyden chamber assays respectively. KEY RESULTS LXA 4, BML-111 and ASA administered as pre- or post-treatment inhibited oedema and neutrophil influx induced by zymosan stimulation. Zymosan-induced preproET-1 mRNA, KC/CXCL1, LTB 4 and TNF-α levels were also decreased after LXA 4 pretreatment. In vitro, ET-1-induced neutrophil chemotaxis was inhibited by LXA 4 pretreatment. LXA 4 treatment also inhibited ET-1-induced oedema formation and neutrophil influx into mouse knee joints. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATION LXA 4 exerted anti-inflammatory effects on articular inflammation through a mechanism that involved the inhibition of ET-1 expression and its effects. © 2010 The British Pharmacological Society. acetylsalicylic acid; BML-111; BOC-1; ET-1; LXA4; neutrophil; oedema formation British Journal of Pharmacology",Ciências Biológicas,Farmacologia,Farmacologia Clínica,Ciências da Saúde,Medicina,Clínica Médica
75,"Retinopathy of prematurity screening and treatment cost in Brazil Objective. To assess the additional cost of incorporating the detection and treatment of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) into neonatal care services of Brazil's Unified Health System (SUS). Methods. A deterministic decision-tree simulation model was built to estimate the direct costs of screening for and treating ROP in neonatal intensive-care units (NICUs), based on data for 869 preterm infants with birth weight less than 1 500 g examined in six governmental NICUs in the capital city of Rio de Janeiro, where coverage was 52% and 8% of infants were treated. All of the parameters from this study were extrapolated to Brazilian newborn estimates in 2010. Costs of screening and treatment were estimated considering staff, equipment and maintenance, and training based on published data and expert opinion. A budget impact analysis was performed considering the population of preterm newborns, screening coverage, and the incidence of treatable ROP. One-and two-way sensitivity analyses were performed. Results. In Rio de Janeiro, unit costs per newborn were US$ 18 for each examination, US$ 398 per treatment, and US$ 29 for training. The estimated cost of ROP diagnosis and treatment for all at-risk infants NICUs was US$ 80 per infant. The additional cost to the SUS for one year would be US$ 556 640 for a ROP program with 52% coverage, increasing to US$ 856 320 for 80% coverage, and US$ 1.07 million or 100% coverage. Conclusions. The results of this study indicate that providing ROP care is affordable within the framework of the SUS in Brazil, and might be feasible elsewhere in Latin America, considering the evidence of the effectiveness of ROP treatment and the social benefits achieved.

76,"Standardization of Nomenclature for Ocular Tuberculosis–Results of Collaborative Ocular Tuberculosis Study (COTS) Workshop Purpose: To standardize a nomenclature system for defining clinical phenotypes, and outcome measures for reporting clinical and research data in patients with ocular tuberculosis (OTB). Methods: Uveitis experts initially administered and further deliberated the survey in an open meeting to determine and propose the preferred nomenclature for terms related to the OTB, terms describing the clinical phenotypes and treatment and reporting outcomes. Results: The group of experts reached a consensus on terming uveitis attributable to tuberculosis (TB) as tubercular uveitis. The working group introduced a SUN-compatible nomenclature that also defines disease “remission” and “cure”, both of which are relevant for reporting treatment outcomes. Conclusion: A consensus nomenclature system has been adopted by a large group of international uveitis experts for OTB. The working group recommends the use of standardized nomenclature to prevent ambiguity in communication and to achieve the goal of spreading awareness of this blinding uveitis entity. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Domestic dogs and small forest mammals are reservoir hosts for L (Leishmania) infantum. However, the role that these animals play in the transmission cycle of the Leishmania spp. that cause cutaneous leishmaniasis is not well known. This study evaluated 72 rodents, 25 marsupials and 98 domestic dogs found in two villages of the Xakriaba Indigenous Territory, an area of intense ATL transmission. A total of 23 dogs (23.47%) were shown to be positive according to at least one test; 8 dogs (8.16%) tested positive in a single serological test and 15 dogs (15.31%) tested positive by IFAT and ELISA. Eleven dogs were euthanised to allow for molecular diagnosis, of which nine (81.8%) tested positive by PCR for Leishmania in at least one tissue. Seven animals were infected only with L (L) infantum, whilst two displayed a mixed infection of L. (L.) infantum and L. (V.) braziliensis. Isoenzymatic characterisation identified L. (L.)infantum parasites isolated from the bone marrow of two dogs. Of the 97 small mammals captured, 24 tested positive for Leishmania by PCR. The results showed that L (V.) braziliensis, L (L.) infantum and L (V.) guyanensis are circulating among wild and synanthropic mammals present in the Xakriaba Reserve, highlighting the epidemiological diversity of ATL in this region.

78,"Assessment of health literacy in diabetic patients followed at a public outpatient clinic; Health literacy (HL), or health literacy, presupposes the knowledge, motivation and skills of individuals to access, understand, evaluate and apply health information in order to make judgments and take decisions in daily life, related to health care, disease prevention and health promotion, to maintain or improve their quality of life. The objective was to measure the level of HL and its associated factors: sex, age, education, income, skin color, self-assessment of health status, type of diabetes and presence of comorbidities. A total of 107 adults with diabetes followed at a public outpatient clinic in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, were evaluated. First-time patients, patients without a diagnosis of diabetes or patients with vision or hearing limitations were not included. HL was assessed using the Brazilian version of the European Health Literacy Survey (HLS-EU-BR). Simple and multiple ordinal logistic regression models were constructed, considering the four levels of HL as the dependent variable. Associations were expressed as odds ratios (ORs). Approximately 95% of the sample presented poor or limited HL (94.8%; 95% CI: 90.3-99.3). Female gender, older age, and lower education were associated with a lower chance of having an excellent HL level. In the adjusted model, only the education variable remained statistically significant in relation to its effect on HL (adjusted OR = 0.41; 95% CI: 0.17-0.98; p < 0.05). Education was the characteristic that was most strongly related to the level of HL.

This study aimed to assess the microbiological quality of natural mineral waters commercialized in 20 L returnable packs in Brazil by investigating the presence of bacteria and viruses in packs with different manufacturing times (T-m). With this purpose, 99 water samples from 33 lots (n = 3/batch) of 15 brands, obtained from packs with three intervals of T-m, were analyzed. Total coliforms (16.2%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (9.9%), sulphite-reducing Clostridium (5.0%) and Escherichia coli (2.0%) were detected but enterococci and norovirus GII not. Regarding brands, 11 (73.3%) presented unsatisfactory results for at least one of the lots analyzed. Pseudomonas aeruginosa analysis revealed six sequence types and strains were susceptible to all antibiotics tested and were able to produce biofilms. Human adenovirus (4) and norovirus GI (9) were also identified in nine samples randomly selected. Natural mineral waters commercialized in 20 L packs with T-m >= 2 years presented more microbiological contamination (P <= 0.012) than ones with a T-m of 0-1 year or a T-m of 1-2 years. These results suggest that the validity period of reusable 20 L packs should be reduced or that they can no longer be reused. viruses,bacteria,water quality,food security,antibiogram,biofilm FEMS MICROBIOLOGY LETTERS",Ciências Biológicas,Microbiologia,Microbiologia Aplicada,Ciências Agrárias,Ciência e Tecnologia de Alimentos,Ciência de Alimentos
81,"Child care, eugenics, and interpretations of Brazil in the construction of Brazil's Children Bureau (Departamento Nacional da Crianca) (1940) The creation of Brazil's Children Bureau (Departamento Nacional da Crianca) in 1940, as part of the construction of a welfare system initiated by the Vargas regime, can be considered a milestone in the history of child care policies in the country. We address the early stages of development of the federal government's child protection services in order to examine the ways trough which child experts sought to define a sphere of professional action for themselves within the State. To deal with such problems as infant mortality and juvenile delinquency, they defended the implementation of a set of health, education, and social assistance policies. We argue that these experts were largely informed by interpretations of Brazil that pointed to the poverty and malnutrition of its population as the main challenge to the nation-building process, and resorted to the language of eugenics in order to stress the social dimension of child welfare's main issues in the country, such as infant mortality and juvenile delinquency. child welfare history,eugenics,Brazil's Children Bureau (Departamento Nacional da Crianca) TEMPO-NITEROI",Ciências Humanas,História,História das Ciências,Ciências Humanas,História,História da América

83,"Advanced chemophenetic analysis of essential oil from leaves of piper gaudichaudianum kunth (Piperaceae) using a new reduction-oxidation index to explore seasonal and circadian rhythms The aromatic species Piper gaudichaudianum Kunth (Piperaceae) is widely used in Brazil for medicinal and ritualistic applications. In the current study, chemophenetic patterns were real-ized across season and circadian rhythm based on the chemical profile of essential oils (EOs) from leaves. Hydrodistilled essential oils were analyzed by GC-MS and GC-FID, and a new calculation of metabolite oxidation level, averaged for each individual molecule component of the EO, was used to explore the patterns of metabolism/biosynthesis. This new index used an intermediate calculation, the ‘weighted average redox standard’ (SRO), to enable a value for mixtures of metabolites to be generated, the ‘general mixture redox index’ (GMOR). The indices were subjected to a proof-of-concept approach by making comparison to outcomes from multivariate analyses, i.e., PCA and HCA. Chemical analysis demonstrated that the essential oils were dominated by sesquiterpenes, constructed of 15 classes of compound (C-skeletons), and 4 C-skeletons were recognized in the monoterpene group, giving a total of 19. The variation of chemical profiles was distinct at different phenological stages, but stronger chemical variation was evident between day and night as compared to season. Furthermore, due to comprehensive sampling across different regions, nine chemotypes were recognized, including those previously reported. The SRO and GMRO indices demonstrate that phenological variation of chemistry is mainly an outcome of redox fluctuations in terpene biosynthesis, changing from day to night.

84,"The impact of large-scale deployment of Wolbachia mosquitoes on dengue and other Aedes-borne diseases in Rio de Janeiro and Niterói, Brazil: Study protocol for a controlled interrupted time series analysis using routine disease surveillance data Background: Rio de Janeiro and Niterói are neighbouring cities in southeastern Brazil which experience large dengue epidemics every 2 to 5 years, with >100,000 cases notified in epidemic years. Costs of vector control and direct and indirect costs due to the Aedes-borne diseases dengue, chikungunya and Zika were estimated to total 650 million USD in 2016, but traditional vector control strategies have not been effective in preventing mosquito-borne disease outbreaks. The Wolbachia method is a novel and self-sustaining approach for the biological control of Aedes-borne diseases, in which the transmission potential of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes is reduced by stably transfecting them with the Wolbachia bacterium ( wMel strain). This paper describes a study protocol for evaluating the effect of large-scale non-randomised releases of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes on the incidence of dengue, Zika and chikungunya in the two cities of Niterói and Rio de Janeiro. This follows a lead-in period since 2014 involving intensive community engagement, regulatory and public approval, entomological surveys, and small-scale pilot releases. Method: The Wolbachia releases during 2017-2019 covered a combined area of 170 km 2 with a resident population of 1.2 million, across Niterói and Rio de Janeiro. Untreated areas with comparable historical dengue profiles and demographic characteristics have been identified a priori as comparative control areas in each city. The proposed pragmatic epidemiological approach combines a controlled interrupted time series analysis of routinely notified suspected and laboratory-confirmed dengue and chikungunya cases, together with monitoring of Aedes-borne disease activity utilising outbreak signals routinely used in public health disease surveillance. Discussion: If the current project is successful, this model for control of mosquito-borne disease through Wolbachia releases can be expanded nationally and regionally. © 2020 Durovni B et al.

86,"Platelet Activating Factor (PAF) Receptor Deletion or Antagonism Attenuates Severe HSV-1 Meningoencephalitis Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is a human pathogen that may cause severe encephalitis. The exacerbated immune response against the virus contributes to the disease severity and death. Platelet activating factor (PAF) is a mediator capable of inducing increase in vascular permeability, production of cytokines on endothelial cells and leukocytes. We aimed to investigate the activation of PAF receptor (PAFR) and its contribution to the severity of the inflammatory response in the brain following HSV-1 infection. C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) and PAFR deficient (PAFR(-/-)) mice were inoculated intracranially with 10(4) plaque-forming units (PFU) of HSV-1. Visualization of leukocyte recruitment was performed using intravital microscopy. Cells infiltration in the brain tissue were analyzed by flow cytometry. Brain was removed for chemokine assessment by ELISA and for histopathological analysis. The pharmacological inhibition by the PAFR antagonist UK-74,505 was also analyzed. In PAFR(-/-) mice, there was delayed lethality but no difference in viral load. Histopathological analysis of infected PAFR(-/-) mice showed that brain lesions were less severe when compared to their WT counterparts. Moreover, PAFR(-/-) mice showed less TCD4(+), TCD8(+) and macrophages in brain tissue. This reduction of the presence of leukocytes in parenchyma may be mechanistically explained by a decrease in leukocytes rolling and adhesion. PAFR(-/-) mice also presented a reduction of the chemokine CXCL9 in the brain. In addition, by antagonizing PAFR, survival of C57BL/6 infected mice increased. Altogether, our data suggest that PAFR plays a role in the pathogenesis of experimental HSV-1 meningoencephalitis, and its blockade prevents severe disease manifestation; Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is a human pathogen that may cause severe encephalitis.

87,"Natural Plasmodium infection in monkeys in the state of Rondonia (Brazilian Western Amazon) Background: Simian malaria is still an open question concerning the species of Plasmodium parasites and species of New World monkeys susceptible to the parasites. In addition, the lingering question as to whether these animals are reservoirs for human malaria might become important especially in a scenario of eradication of the disease. To aid in the answers to these questions, monkeys were surveyed for malaria parasite natural infection in the Amazonian state of Rondonia, Brazil, a state with intense environmental alterations due to human activities, which facilitated sampling of the animals. Methods: Parasites were detected and identified in DNA from blood of monkeys, by PCR with primers for the 18S rRNA, CSP and MSP1 genes and sequencing of the amplified fragments. Multiplex PCR primers for the 18S rRNA genes were designed for the parasite species Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium malariae/Plasmodium brasilianum and Plasmodium simium. Results: An overall infection rate of 10.9% was observed or 20 out 184 monkey specimens surveyed, mostly by P. brasilianum. However, four specimens of monkeys were found infected with P. falciparum, two of them doubly infected with P. brasilianum and P. falciparum. In addition, a species of monkey of the family Aotidae, Aotus nigriceps, is firstly reported here naturally infected with P. brasilianum. None of the monkeys surveyed was found infected with P. simium/P. vivax. Conclusion: The rate of natural Plasmodium infection in monkeys in the Brazilian state of Rondonia is in line with previous surveys of simian malaria in the Amazon region. The fact that a monkey species was found that had not previously been described to harbour malaria parasites indicates that the list of monkey species susceptible to Plasmodium infection is yet to be completed. Furthermore, finding monkeys in the region infected with P. falciparum clearly indicates parasite transfer from humans to the animals. Whether this parasite can be transferred back to humans and how persistent the parasite is in monkeys in the wild so to be efficient reservoirs of the disease, is yet to be evaluated. Finding different species of monkeys infected with this parasite species suggests indeed that these animals can act as reservoirs of human malaria.

88,"Teaching Women to Be Mothers: Medicine, Maternalism, and the Women's Press in Brazil (1910-1930) Analyzes the actions of assistance to maternity and childhood implemented in Brazil, considering mother and child, two ""new"" social subjects, as a priority object of social concern and intervention by the State, which preceded their institutionalization. It conceives the constitution of this type of assistance in Brazil as, among other dimensions, one of the derivations of the hygienist agenda and the result of the conformation, diffusion, and incorporation of the maternalist ideology and the principles of scientific motherhood - understood as the exercise of motherhood based on scientific foundations, object of its own educational practices, and supervised by doctors. Although primarily expressed by doctors, the discourse of scientific motherhood found an echo in the republican nationalist project - in particular, the convergence of identities between health, education and nation - and in the demands of maternalist feminist movements, consolidating, especially in the 1910s and 1920s, a set of ideas about motherhood and childhood that became the main source of inspiration for public policies implemented from 1930 onwards. She chooses as priority sources of research on the process of construction of the materialist discourse three magazines that circulated in the main urban centres of the period: Vida Domestica 1920-1963, Revista Femenina 1914-1936 and Infancia 1935-1938 [AU] Saúde Pública/história,Feminismo/história,Política de Saúde,Política Pública,Cuidado da Criança/história,Comportamento Maternal, Hygiene/history, Brazil, Periodical Publication/history",Ciências Humanas,História,,Ciências Humanas,História,História das Ciências
89,"Reproducibility on science: Challenges and advances in Brazilian alcohol surveys Background: Reproducibility in Science is challenging and may be hard to achieve in alcohol research. Previous general population surveys in Brazil have estimated the prevalence of alcohol dependence to be around 10%. We aim to estimate alcohol use and dependence using different methods and definitions. Methods: The 3rd Brazilian Household Survey on Substance Use (BHSU-3) was a nationwide, probability sample survey that interviewed 16,273 individuals. DSM-IV-TR criteria were used to determine alcohol dependence. In the BHSU-2 (covering only Brazil's 108 largest municipalities), alcohol dependence was defined as fulfilling 2/6 DSM-III criteria. Using the BHSU-3 data, alcohol use was estimated at: [1] the national level, [2] BHSU-2 municipalities, taking into consideration the sample design, and [3] BHSU-2 municipalities, ignoring the sample design. Alcohol dependence was calculated using: BHSU-3 and BHSU-2 definitions, two denominators ([A] population and [B] 12-month drinkers), and [1], [2], [3]. Results: Lifetime alcohol use ranged from 66.4% (95%CI:64.8-68.0 [1]) to 70.1% ([95%CI:69.1-71.0], [3]). The estimated population presenting with alcohol dependence ranged from N = 2.3 million (BHSU-3 definition, [1]) to N = 4.3 million (BHSU-2 definition, [1]). In the first case, the prevalence among the general population [A] and drinkers [B] was 1.5% (95%CI:1.2-1.8) and 3.5% (95%CI:2.8-4.2), respectively. In second case, prevalence was 2.8% (95%CI:2.4-3.3, [A]) and 6.6% (95%CI:5.6-7.6, [B]). Conclusions: Prevalence of alcohol dependence may vary as much as 4.3 times, analyzing the same dataset in different ways. Brazilian research on alcohol is funded by governmental research and policy-making agencies, providing subsidies for alcohol policy in the country. It is crucial that sufficient methodological information is provided in order to guarantee reproducibility and consistency over time.

90,"The Influence of Environmental Cues on the Development of Trypanosoma cruzi in Triatominae Vector Trypanosoma cruzi, a hemoflagellate parasite, is the etiological agent of Chagas disease that affects about 6-7 million people worldwide, mostly in Latin America. The parasite life cycle is complex and alternates between an invertebrate host-Triatominae vector-and a mammalian host. The parasite adaptation to the several microenvironments through which it transits is critical to success in establishing infection. Moreover, environmental cues also play an important role on the parasite development, and it can modulate the infection. In the present study, we discussed how the temperature oscillations and the nutritional state of the invertebrate host can affect the parasite development, multiplication, and the differentiation process of epimastigote forms into metacyclic trypomastigotes, called metacyclogenesis. The impact of oxidative imbalance and osmotic stresses on the parasite-vector relationship are also discussed.

91,"The effect of dietary fibers on the absorption of oral hypoglycemic drugs: a systematic review of controlled trials Purpose: Dietary fibers and hypoglycemic drugs can be used concomitantly in the treatment of diabetes mellitus. We aimed to perform this review in order to evaluate whether scientific evidence is available regarding the interaction between these components and whether these interactions alter drug absorption. Methods: We conducted a search of the literature for controlled clinical trials that evaluated the occurrence and clinical relevance of interactions between dietary fibers and hypoglycemic drugs. Six databases were searched from inception to April 20, 2020 and trials were eligible for inclusion if they measured changes in drug absorption parameters. Results: In three studies, there were interactions between dietary fibers and hypoglycemic drugs, causing alterations in drug absorption. The other two studies had no significant changes in absorption pharmacokinetic parameters. Conclusions: The physicochemical characteristics of the dietary fiber used, the chemical structure of the drug, and the pharmaceutical form administered are determining factors for the occurrence of alterations in drug absorption. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Research Society for Study of Diabetes in India.

92,"COX-2 rs20417 Polymorphism Is Associated with Stroke and White Matter Disease Background: To investigate the effect of COX-2 polymorphism and its product, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), on stroke risk in an endemic area for Chagas disease. In a separate cohort, to investigate the effect of COX-2 polymorphisms on the total burden of cerebral white matter disease. Methods: Cases were outpatients with ischemic stroke; controls were stroke-free subjects from 2 outpatient clinics (heart failure and caregivers of a movement disorders clinic). We extracted DNA from total blood to investigate the rs20417 COX-2 polymorphism. Serologic tests (Enzime-linked immunosorbent assay) were performed to confirm Trypanosoma cruzi infection and to quantify PGE2 levels. In the Boston cohort, white matter hyperintensity volume (WMHv) was quantified on the admission brain magnetic resonance images of subjects with ischemic stroke, who also donated DNA for the COX-2 gene region analysis. Results: We studied 44 patients with stroke and 96 controls (46 with heart failure and 50 caregivers) in the Brazilian cohort; and 788 stroke patients (302 cardioembolic and 486 noncardioembolic) in the Boston cohort. In the Brazilian cohort, rs20417 polymorphism was associated with both stroke (P = 5 x 10(-6)) and decreased PGE2 levels (P = 4 x 10(-5)); similarly, Chagas was associated with stroke (P = 4 x 10(-3)) and decreased PGE2 levels (P = 7 x 10(-3)). In the Boston cohort, rs20417 polymorphism was associated with increased WMHv among noncardioembolic (P = .037), but not among cardioembolic stroke patients. Conclusions: Variation in COX-2 gene is associated with both symptomatic and silent brain cerebrovascular disease. This candidate gene region should be tested in population-based samples.

96,"Toxicological evaluation of Euterpe edulis: A potential superfruit to be considered Superfruits have a high nutritional value due to their richness in nutrients, antioxidants, proven or potential health benefits and taste appeal. However, there are no scientific criteria for defining which fruits are superfruits. In Brazil, several palms have an edible palm heart, the best known and most widely appreciated of which is called Acai (. Euterpe oleracea). Euterpe edulis Mart., commonly called jussara, is an evergreen species that grows in the rainforest. Having initially been consumed in the form of juice and pulp, they have since been incorporated as an ingredient in many foods. A risk assessment to identify adverse health effects is a prerequisite for taking forward the development of new drugs, cosmetics and foods. To make a toxicological evaluation of E. edulis, in the present work this prerequisite was met by an interdisciplinary network that performed mass spectroscopy analyses, blood biochemistry, genotoxicity, bacterial reverse mutation and cytotoxicity assays. Positive mutagenicity results were detected for Salmonella typhimurium TA97 at low doses, and positive results were also obtained for the mammalian erythrocyte micronucleus assay, indicating that the pulp of E. edulis contains compounds with the capacity to induce mutagenicity and clastogenic/aneugenic effects. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

99,"Assessing the nationwide impact of COVID-19 mitigation policies on the transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil COVID-19 is now identified in almost all countries in the world, with poorer regions being particularly more disadvantaged to efficiently mitigate the impacts of the pandemic. In the absence of efficient therapeutics or large-scale vaccination, control strategies are currently based on non-pharmaceutical interventions, comprising changes in population behavior and governmental interventions, among which the prohibition of mass gatherings, closure of non-essential establishments, quarantine and movement restrictions. In this work we analyzed the effects of 707 governmental interventions published up to May 22, 2020, and population adherence thereof, on the dynamics of COVID-19 cases across all 27 Brazilian states, with emphasis on state capitals and remaining inland cities. A generalized SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected and Removed) model with a time-varying transmission rate (TR), that considers transmission by asymptomatic individuals, is presented. We analyze the effect of both the extent of enforced measures across Brazilian states and population movement on the changes in the TR and effective reproduction number. The social mobility reduction index, a measure of population movement, together with the stringency index, adapted to incorporate the degree of restrictions imposed by governmental regulations, were used in conjunction to quantify and compare the effects of varying degrees of policy strictness across Brazilian states. Our results show that population adherence to social distance recommendations plays an important role for the effectiveness of interventions and represents a major challenge to the control of COVID-19 in low-and middle-income countries.

100,"Il-8 is Associated with Non-viremic State and Ifn- with Biochemical Activity in Hcv-seropositive Blood Donors|Il-8 is Associated with Non-viremic State and Ifn-? with Biochemical Activity in Hcv-seropositive Blood Donors; IL-8 Is Associated with Non-Viremic State and IFN-gamma with Biochemical Activity in HCV-Seropositive Blood Donors Objective: The aim of this study was to explore a possible association between the pattern of serum cytokines with the virological and biochemical status of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-seropositive blood donors. Methods: 23 non-viremic and 33 viremic HCV-seropositive blood donors based on HCV-RNA tests, and 29 healthy individuals were included. Cytometric bead array assays were performed to detect cytokines. Results: The subjects were classified as low, medium or high cytokine producers based on the tertile distribution. The absence of detectable viremia was associated with high IL-1 beta and IL-8 producers. Conversely, elevated levels of IL-6, IL-10 and IL-12 were associated with detectable viremia. An increased frequency of high IL-1 beta producers was observed frequently in the non-viremic recombinant immunoblot assay (RIBA)-indeterminate subjects, while the high IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and IL-12 producers were more frequent in the non-viremic RIBA-positive subjects. Furthermore, the levels of IL-1 beta and IL-8 were higher in viremic subjects with a low level of alanine-aminotransferase (ALT), whereas the level of IFN-gamma was increased among viremic subjects with a high ALT level. Conclusion: IL-1 beta and IL-8 were more likely to be associated with a non-viremic or less severe HCV infection, whereas IL-2 and IFN-gamma levels correlated with a high ALT level.

101,"Actividad antifúngica de la altenusina aislada del hongo endofítico Alternaria sp. frente al hongo patógeno Paracoccidioides brasiliensis Background. Altenusin is a biphenyl derivative isolated from different species of fungi, which presents several biological activities. Aims. We report the antifungal activity of the altenusin isolated from the endophytic fungus Alternaria sp., against clinical isolates of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, and its action on cell walls of P. brasiliensis and the nonpathogenic yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Methods. In vitro antifungal activity of altenusin was evaluated using the broth microdilution method against 11 strains of P. brasiliensis and one strain of S. pombe. The effects of the altenusin on the cell wall were estimated using the sorbitol protection assay. Results. The altenusin presented strong activity against P. brasiliensis with MIC values ranging between 1.9 and 31.2&#956;g/ml, and 62.5&#956;g/ml for S. pombe. Our results demonstrated that the MIC values for altenusin were increased for P. brasiliensis Pb18 and for S. pombe when the medium was supplemented with sorbitol. Additionally, S. pombe cells treated with altenusin were more rounded in shape than untreated cells. Conclusions. Altenusin showed activity against clinical strains of P. brasiliensis at the concentration tested, and this compound probably affects fungal cell walls. These findings suggest that altenusin could act through the inhibition of cell wall synthesis or assembly in P. brasiliensis and S. pombe, and could be considered as a lead compound for the design of new antifungals(AU) Anticorpos Antifúngicos/isolamento &amp; purificação,Anticorpos Antifúngicos/metabolismo,Antifúngicos/isolamento &amp; purificação,Alternaria/isolamento &amp; purificação,Alternaria/patogenicidade,Paracoccidioides/isolamento &amp; purificação,Paracoccidioides/patogenicidade,Diluição/métodos,Alternaria/imunologia,Paracoccidioides/imunologia,/métodos,Sorbitol,Schizosaccharomyces/isolamento &amp; purificação,Schizosaccharomyces/patogenicidade Revista Iberoam Micol",Ciências Biológicas,Microbiologia,Biologia e Fisiologia dos Microorganismos,Ciências Biológicas,Microbiologia,Microbiologia Aplicada
102,"The influence of different sources of blood meals on the physiology of Aedes aegypti harboring WolbachiawMel: mouse blood as an alternative for mosquito rearing Background: Aedes aegypti control programs have failed to restrain mosquito population expansion and, consequently, the spread of diseases such as dengue, Zika, and Chikungunya. Wolbachia infection of mosquitoes is a new and promising complementary tool for the control of arbovirus transmission. The use of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes, mass reared using human blood, is currently being tested in several countries. However, the use of human blood for mass rearing mosquitoes, and thus expansion of this strategy, is problematic. With the aim of overcoming this problem, we tested the effect of different types of blood source on the fitness parameters of female Ae. aegypti and the Wolbachia titer over generations to be able to guarantee the suitability of an alternative source to human blood for mass rearing Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes. Methods: We investigated and compared essential parameters of the vector capacity of laboratory strains of Ae. aegypti with and without Wolbachia that fed on blood of different types of host (human, guinea pig, and mouse). The parameters analyzed were fecundity, fertility, pupation dynamics, and adult survival. Also, we tested whether it is possible to maintain mosquitoes with Wolbachia on mouse blood over generations without losing the bacterium titer. Results: The average number of eggs per female, egg viability and pupation dynamics in the Wolbachia-infected mosquito (wMelBr) strain were similar, regardless of the blood source. The F1 progenies of females that fed on mouse blood or human blood were analyzed. The longevity of males was lower than that of females. F1 female survival differed depending on the presence of Wolbachia in the mother. In subsequent generations analyzed up until F35, the relative Wolbachia density was even higher when mosquitoes fed on mouse blood in comparison to human blood. Conclusions: Taken together, our results provide no evidence that the different types of blood influenced the fitness of the Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes. The presence of the bacterium in the colonies of Wolbachia-infected Ae. aegypti after 35 generations under the conditions evaluated indicates that they can be maintained on mouse blood. Based on these results, we show that it is possible to use mouse blood to feed female mosquitoes when using human blood for this purpose is problematic.

Compounds 1f (aryl = 3-ethoxyphenyl), 1g (Ar = 3,4,5-(MeO) 3-C 6H 2) and 2c were slightly more active than mefloquine (MIC = 33 μM) with MICs = 24.5, 22.5 and 27.4, respectively, whereas compounds 1e (aryl = 3,4-(MeO) 2-C 6H 3) and 2a (MICs = 11.9 and 12.1 μM, respectively) were ca. 2.7 times more active than mefloquine, with a better tuberculostatic activity than the first line tuberculostatic agent ethambutol (MIC = 15.9). The compounds were also assayed against the MDR strain T113 and the same MICs were observed. Thus the new derivatives have advantages over such anti-TB drugs as isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol and ofloxacin, for which this strain is resistant. The most active compounds were not cytotoxic to Murine Macrophages Cells in a concentration near their MIC values. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

104,"A Strong Humoral Immune Response Induced by a Vaccine Formulation Containing rSm29 Adsorbed to Alum Is Associated With Protection Against Schistosoma mansoni Reinfection in Mice The helminth Schistosoma mansoni is one of main causes of human schistosomiasis, a health and economic concern in some of the world's poorest countries. Current treatment regimens can lead to serious side effects and are not suitable for breastfeeding mothers. As such, efforts have been undertaken to develop a vaccine to prevent infection. Of these, Sm29 is a promising candidate that has been associated with resistance to infection/reinfection in humans and mice. Its ability to induce resistance to reinfection has also been recently demonstrated using a vaccine formulation containing Freund's adjuvant. However, Freund's adjuvant is unsuitable for use in human vaccines. We therefore evaluated the ability of Sm29 to induce protection against S. mansoni reinfection when formulated with either alum or MPLA as an adjuvant, both approved for human use. Our data demonstrate that, in contrast to Sm29 with MPLA, Sm29 with alum reduced parasite burden after reinfection compared to a control. We next investigated whether the immune response was involved in creating the differences between the protective (Sm29Alum) and non-protective (Sm29MPLA) vaccine formulations. We observed that both formulations induced a similar mixed-profile immune response, however, the Sm29 with alum formulation raised the levels of antibodies against Sm29. This suggests that there is an association between a reduction in worm burden and parasite-specific antibodies. In summary, our data show that Sm29 with an alum adjuvant can successfully protect against S. mansoni reinfection in mice, indicating a potentially effective vaccine formulation that could be applied in humans.

105,"Novel MLST sequence types of pathogenic Leptospira spp.: Opening the black Chock for box of animal leptospirosis in Brazil In the current context of the emergence of certain infectious diseases and discussion of the One Health concept for many of these, the study of leptospirosis both in domestic and wild hosts cannot be neglected. The study of animal leptospirosis has evolved in recent years. It has been demonstrated that the human-animal-environment interface is more important than previously thought. In the present study, 35 strains of five pathogenic Leptospira species were isolated from different animal species in Brazil and characterized by rrs, secY, and Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST) sequencing. Phylogenetic inferences were performed and the molecular diversity of the populations (intra- and inter-population levels) was evaluated. Among the five studied species, 18 different sequence types (STs) were found (22 new alleles and 11 new STs). eBURST analysis revealed two clonal complexes (CCs) and seven singletons. A high genetic diversity was demonstrated (H = 0.954 +/- 0.017), mainly for the L. santarosai population (H = 0.942 +/- 0.034, n = 20). The same strain was identified in different host species, as well as strains with zoonotic potential circulating in the country. Although the difficulty of culturing Leptospira strains is well known, the high variability of the strains found in Brazil highlights the importance of animals in maintaining the biological cycle of the bacterium in nature. Moreover, the selection of autochthonous strains for the development of vaccines becomes a challenge.

106,"Giant Chorioangioma Treated In Utero via Laser of Feeding Vessels with Subsequent Development of Multifocal Infantile Hemangiomas We report a case of a giant placental chorioangioma (15.6 cm diameter) complicated by polyhydramnios and severe fetal heart failure. Fetoscopic laser occlusion of a dominant feeding vessel was performed at 29 weeks' gestation and partial devascularization was achieved. In the 33rd week of the pregnancy, the decision was made to preemptively deliver the fetus due to persistent signs of fetal cardiac failure. After birth, the infant developed multifocal infantile hemangiomas with extracutaneous involvement. We posit that the development of infantile hemangiomas may be linked to the presence of the large chorioangioma. Further study is required to ascertain if fetal treatment of the chorioangioma may have been an exacerbating factor. placental tumor,chorioangioma,fetoscopy,fetal treatment,hemangioma FETAL AND PEDIATRIC PATHOLOGY",Ciências da Saúde,Medicina,Saúde Materno-Infantil,Ciências da Saúde,Medicina,Saúde Materno-Infantil
107,"Different classical hydrogen-bonding patterns in three salicylaldoxime derivatives, 2-HO-4-XC6H3C=NOH (X = Me, OH and MeO) The crystal structures of three salicyaldoxime compounds, namely 2-hydroxy-4-methylbenzaldehyde oxime, C 8 H 9 NO 2, 1, 2,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde oxime, C 7 H 7 NO 3, 2, and 2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzaldehyde oxime, C 8 H 9 NO 3, 3, are discussed. In each compound, the hydroxyl groups are essentially coplanar with their attached phenyl group. The interplanar angles between the C=N - O moieties of the oxime unit and their attached phenyl rings are 0.08 (9), 1.08 (15) and 6.65 (15)° in 1, 2 and 3, respectively. In all three molecules, the 2-hydroxy group forms an intramolecular O - H⋯N(oxime) hydrogen bond. In compound (1), intermolecular O - H(oxime)⋯O(hydroxyl) hydrogen bonds generate R 2 2 (14) dimers, related by inversion centres. In compound 2, intermolecular O - H(oxime)⋯O(4-hydroxy) hydrogen bonds generate C9 chains along the b-axis direction, while O - H(4-hydroxyl)⋯O(2-hydroxyl) interactions form zigzag C6 spiral chains along the c-axis direction, generated by a screw axis at 1, y, 1/4: the combination of the two chains provides a bimolecular sheet running parallel to the b axis, which lies between 0-1/2 c and 1/2-1 c. In compound 3, similar C9 chains, along the b-axis direction are generated by O - H(oxime)⋯O(4-methoxy) hydrogen bonds. Further weaker, C - H⋯π (in 1), π-π (in 2) and both C - H⋯π and π-π interactions (in 3) further cement the three-dimensional structures.

108,"Contributions from the Critical Success Factors model to analysis of the management of Product Development Partnerships in a government laboratory Product Development Partnerships (PDP) are one of the measures used by the Brazilian government to incentivize innovation policy, to expand the population's access to strategic medicines, and to reduce the country's technological dependence by strengthening the national pharmaceutical manufacturing base. The study aimed to identify the Critical Success Factors (FCS in Portuguese) for the implementation of these partnerships, using as the reference one of the largest Brazilian government pharmaceutical laboratories. FCS are seen as key areas in which the results must be satisfactory in order to ensure successful performance in the organization or project. The methodological strategies included literature review, analysis of internal documents, and semi-structured interviews with key actors. We analyzed the partnerships approved for this public laboratory from 2009 to May 2018. The study enabled a critical view of the phases in a PDP and identification of specific critical factors for this type of project. The findings reveal persistent organizational challenges for increasing the executability of partnerships, which can serve as a reference for other government laboratories that have PDP agreements under way or that intend to submit proposals for them. © 2020 Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz.

111,"Evaluation of 7-arylaminopyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidines as anti-Plasmodium falciparum, antimalarial, and Pf-dihydroorotate dehydrogenase inhibitors Malaria remains one of the most serious global infectious diseases. An important target for antimalarial chemotherapy is the enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase from Plasmodium falciparum (PfDHODH), which is responsible for the conversion of dihydroorotate to orotate in the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway. In this study, we have designed and synthesized fifteen 7-arylpyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine derivatives using ring bioisosteric replacement and molecular hybridization of functional groups based on the highly active 5-methyl-N-(naphthalen-2-yl)-2-(trifluoromethyl)- [1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidin-7-amine. The compounds were tested against Plasmodium falciparum, as antimalarials in mice with P. berghei, and as inhibitors of PfDHODH. Thirteen compounds were found to be active against P. falciparum, with IC50values ranging from 1.2 ± 0.3 to 92 ± 26 μM in the anti-HRP2 and hypoxanthine assays. Four compounds showed the highest selective index (SI), which is a ratio between cytotoxicity and activity in vitro. The inhibition of PfDHODH showed that compound 30 (R2= CH3; R5= CF3; Ar = 7-β-naphthyl) displayed higher and selective inhibitory activity, with IC50= 0.16 ± 0.01 μM, followed by 25 (R2= CH3; R5= CH3; Ar = 7-β-Naphthyl) and 19 (R2= CF3; R5= CF3; Ar = 7-β-naphthyl), with IC50= 4 ± 1 μM and 6 ± 1 μM, respectively. The trifluoromethyl group at the 2- or 5-positions of the pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine ring led to increased drug activity.

112,"Novel SNPs and INDEL polymorphisms in the 3'UTR of DGAT1 gene: in silico analyses and a possible association Diacylglycerol-O-acyltransferase (DGAT1) gene encodes the rate-limiting enzyme of triglyceride synthesis. A polymorphism in this gene, DGAT1 K232A, has been associated with milk production and composition in taurine breeds. However, this polymorphism is not a good tool for ascertaining the effects of this QTL in Bos indicus (Zebu), since the frequency of the DGAT1 232A allele is too low in these breeds. We sequenced the 3'-untranslated region of DGAT1 gene in a sample of bulls of the breeds Guzera (Bos indicus) and Holstein (Bos taurus) and, using in silico analysis, we searched for genetic variation, evolutionary conservation, regulatory elements, and possible substitution effects. Six single nucleotide (SNPs) and one insertion-deletion (INDEL) polymorphisms were found in the Guzera bulls. Additionally, we developed a preliminary association study, using this INDEL polymorphism as a genetic marker. A significant association was detected (P a parts per thousand currency sign 0.05) between the INDEL (DGAT1 3'UTR INDEL) and the breeding values (BV) for protein, fat, and milk yields over a 305-day lactation period. The DGAT1 3' UTR INDEL genotype I/I (I, for insertion) was associated with lower BVs (-38.77 kg for milk, -1.86 kg for fat, and -1.48 kg for protein yields), when compared to the genotype I/D (D, for deletion). I/D genotype was lower D/D genotype (-34.98 kg milk, -1.73 kg fat, and -1.09 kg protein yields). This study reports the first polymorphism of DGAT1 3'UTR in the Guzera breed, as well as its association with BV for milk protein, fat, and milk yields.

114,"The Dermatophyte Trichophyton rubrum Induces Neutrophil Extracellular Traps Release by Human Neutrophils Neutrophils are the first leukocytes recruited to the site of infection and are thought to be responsible for fungal elimination from the skin such as dermatophytes. Neutrophils are able to secrete reactive oxygen species (ROS) and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) that can kill different fungi, including Aspergillus, spp., Candida albicans, and Phialophora verrucosa. However, NET production in response to Trichophyton rubrum, the main etiologic agent of dermatophytosis, has yet to be studied. We demonstrated that human neutrophils produce NETs against different morphotypes of T. rubrum in a dose-dependent manner and NET formation is dependent on ROS production. In addition, ROS production by human neutrophils in response to T. rubrum is dependent on NADPH oxidase, but not on fungal viability. NETs mediated killing of T. rubrum. Collectively, these results demonstrate that T. rubrum was able to trigger the production of NETs, suggesting that these extracellular structures may represent an important innate immune effector mechanism controlling physiological response to T. rubrum infection. dermatophytosis,Trichophyton rubrum,neutrophils,neutrophil extracellular traps,fungal killing,innate immunity JOURNAL OF FUNGI",Ciências Biológicas,Microbiologia,Microbiologia Aplicada,Ciências Biológicas,Imunologia,Imunologia Aplicada

116,"Congenital Zika syndrome: Growth, clinical, and motor development outcomes up to 36 months of age and differences according to microcephaly at birth Background: Little is known regarding the developmental consequences of congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) without microcephaly at birth. Most previously published clinical series were descriptive and they had small sample sizes. Study design: We conducted a cohort study to compare the growth, clinical, and motor development outcomes for 110 children with CZS born with and without microcephaly up to their third birthday. Ninety-three had their head circumference (HC) at birth abstracted and they did not have hypertensive hydrocephalus at birth, where 61 were born with microcephaly and 32 without. Results: The HC z-scores decreased steeply from birth to six months of age, i.e., from ?3.77 to ?6.39 among those with microcephaly at birth and from ?1.03 to ?3.84 among those without. Thus, at 6 months of age, the mean HC z-scores for children born without microcephaly were nearly the same as those for children born with microcephaly. Children born without microcephaly were less likely to have brain damage, ophthalmic abnormalities, and drug-resistant epilepsy, but the differences in many conditions were not statistically significant. Conclusions: Children born without microcephaly were only slightly less likely to present severe neurologic impairment and to develop postnatal-onset microcephaly, and some of the original differences between the groups tended to dissipate with age. ? 2021 The Authors.

117,"Multiple inflammatory markers and 15-year incident ADL disability in admixed older adults: The Bambui-Epigen Study Background: The ability of inflammatory markers to predict disability in later life has received growing attention. However, the current evidence came predominantly from Caucasians and the role of genomic ancestry has not been investigated. Objective: We investigated the prognostic value of multiple citokynes and chemokines for incident disability in admixed older Brazilians and whether genomic African and Native American ancestry affects the association. Design: Population-based longitudinal study. Setting: The Bambui-Epigen (Brazil) Cohort Study of Aging. Subjects: 1171 males and females aged >= 60 years over 15-year of follow-up. Methods: Outcome examined was incident activity of daily living (ADL) disability assessed annually (10,039 measures were performed). Serum levels of citokynes (IL6, IL12, TNF, IL10, and IL1 beta) and chemokines (CCL2, CCL5, CXCL8, CXCL9 and CXCL10) were measured at baseline. We used 370,539 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) to estimate each individual genomic ancestry proportions. Potential confounding variables included a wide range of socio-demographic variables and health indicators. Statistical analyses were based on competing risk framework. Results: The incidence rate of disability was 57.9 per 1000 person-years. IL6 level at the highest quartile showed an independent association with ADL disability (SRH = 1.32; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.70). Other inflammatory markers showed no statistically significant associations with the outcome. Neither genomic African nor Native American ancestry had an effect modifier on the associations (P for interaction > 0.05 for all). Conclusion: Among multi-inflammatory markers, only IL6 had the potential to identify people at increased risk of ADL disability, independently of ethno-racial background.; Background: The ability of inflammatory markers to predict disability in later life has received growing attention.

We used 370,539 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) to estimate each individual genomic ancestry proportions. Potential confounding variables included a wide range of socio-demographic variables and health indicators. Statistical analyses were based on competing risk framework.Results: The incidence rate of disability was 57.9 per 1000 person-years. IL6 level at the highest quartile showed an independent association with ADL disability (SRH = 1.32; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.70). Other inflammatory markers showed no statistically significant associations with the outcome. Neither genomic African nor Native American ancestry had an effect modifier on the associations (P for interaction >0.05 for all).Conclusion: Among multi-inflammatory markers, only IL6 had the potential to identify people at increased risk of ADL disability, independently of ethno-racial background.

119,"Leishmania (V.) braziliensis infecting bats from Pantanal wetland, Brazil: First records for Platyrrhinus lineatus and Artibeus planirostris In the New World genus Leishmania parasites are etiological agents of neglected zoonoses known as leishmaniasis. Its epidemiology is very complex due to the participation of several species of sand fly vectors and mammalian hosts, and man is an accidental host. Control is very difficult because of the different epidemiological patterns of transmission observed. Studies about Leishmania spp. infection in bats are so scarce, which represents a large gap in knowledge about the role of these animals in the transmission cycle of these pathogens, especially when considering that Chiroptera is one of the most abundant and diverse orders among mammals. Leishmaniasis in Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil are remarkably frequent, probably due to the abundance of its regional mastofauna. The recent record of L. braziliensis in bats from this state indicates the need to clarify the role of these mammals in the transmission cycle. In this study we evaluated the presence of Leishmania parasites in the skin of different species of bats, using PCR directed to Leishmania spp. kDNA for screening followed by PCR/RFLP analysis of the hsp70 gene for the identification of parasite species. Leishmania species identification was confirmed by PCR directed to the G6PD gene of L. braziliensis, followed by sequencing of the PCR product. Samples from 47 bats were processed, of which in three specimens (6.38%) was detected the presence of Leishmania sp. kDNA. PCR/RFLP and sequencing identified the species involved in the infection as L. braziliensis in all of them. This is the first report of Leishmania braziliensis in bats from Pantanal ecosystem and the first record of this species in Platyrrhinus lineatus and Artibeus planirostris, bats with a wide distribution in South America. These results reinforce the need to deepen the knowledge about the possibility of bats act as reservoirs of Leishmania spp. especially considering their ability of dispersion and occupation of anthropic environments.

120,"The leishmanicidal activity of a cyclopentenedione derivative isolated from the roots of a native Amazonian pepper (Piper carniconnectivum) The Piper species chemistry has been widely investigated and the phytochemical analyses have led to the isolation of a number of active compounds like alkaloids, terpenes and flavones among others. The aim of this study was to evaluate the leishmanicidal activity of 2-[1-hydroxy-3-phenyl-(Z,2E)-2-propenylidene]-4-methyl-4-cyclopentene-1,3-dione (DCPC), a cyclopentenedione derivative isolated from the roots of Piper carniconnectivum C. DC., Piperaceae. Leishmanicidal activity against Leishmania amazonensis promastigotes was assessed, and the risk to host cell was assessed by measuring the cytotoxicity to peritoneal macrophages from BALB/c mice in vitro. L. amazonensis promastigotes and host macrophages were cultured in the presence of 100, 50, 25, 12.5 and 6 mu g/mL of the cyclopentenedione derivative for up to 96 h. At the end of this period, the inhibitory concentrations (IC50) were compared with those from untreated cultures. The IC50 for promastigotes was 4.4 mu g/mL after 96 h of treatment with the derivative. The 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50) against murine peritoneal macrophages was 129 mu g/mL. These results indicate that DCPC is a promising molecule for the development of leishmanicidal drugs. cyclopentenedione,Leishmania amazonensis,leishmanicidal activity,Piper carniconnectivum,Piperaceae Brazilian Journal of Pharmacognosy",Ciências Biológicas,Parasitologia,Entomologia e Malacologia de Parasitos e Vetores,Ciências Biológicas,Farmacologia,Etnofarmacologia

122,"Study of the dynamic behavior of the cruzain enzyme in free and complexed forms with competitive and noncovalent benzimidazole inhibitors There are only two drugs for the treatment of Chagas disease, namely, nifurtimox and benznidazole, that can cause several adverse effects. Despite the effectiveness of these drugs in the disease's acute phase, they are not recognized as curative in the chronic phase, establishing the need for more effective treatment in all stages of the disease. Cruzain is an enzyme that plays a vital role in the life cycle of the etiologic agent, the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, being relevant as a therapeutic target in the planning of new drugs. Using molecular docking and dynamics simulations, we have investigated the structural and dynamic factors that can be involved in the enzyme inhibition process at the atomic-molecular level by benzimidazole compounds that are potent cruzain inhibitors with in vitro trypanocidal activity. The study suggests that these inhibitors bind cruzain through steric and hydrogen bonding interactions without altering its secondary structure content and protein compaction. Besides, we observed that these inhibitors decrease the correlation of movements between Cα-atoms of cruzain, increasing the number of atomic communities, mainly in the α-helix that presents the catalytic Cys25 residue. As expected, we also observed a correlation between the inhibitory activity of each inhibitor and their respective binding-free energies, reinforcing that the affinity of the complexes seems to be a relevant factor for enzymatic inhibition. Hence, the results presented in this work contribute to a better understanding of the cruzain enzyme inhibition mechanism through competitive and non-covalent inhibitors. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

124,"Tracking the Ovarian Cycle in Black-and-Gold Howlers (Alouatta caraya) by Measuring Fecal Steroids and Observing Vaginal Bleeding A better understanding of a species' reproductive physiology can help conservation programs to manage primates in the wild and develop assisted reproductive technologies in captivity. We investigated whether measurements of fecal progestin and estrogen metabolites obtained by a radioimmunoassay could be used to monitor the ovarian cycle of Alouatta caraya. We also compared the occurrence of vaginal bleeding with the hormone profiles. We collected fecal samples from 3 adult and 1 subadult captive female over 5 mo and performed vaginal cytology for the adults. The interval between fecal progestin surges in the adult females was 19.11 +/- 2.14 d (n = 18 cycles). Fecal progestin concentrations remained at basal values for 9.83 +/- 2.21 d (n = 18) and rose to elevated values for 9.47 +/- 0.72 d (n = 19). The subadult female showed basal levels of fecal estrogen and progestin concentrations throughout the study, suggesting that our hormone measurements are valid to monitor the ovarian cycle. Bleeding periods coincided with basal levels of fecal estrogens and progestin at intervals of 19.8 +/- 0.9 d and lasted for 4.1 +/- 1.0 d. Although we obtained these data from only 3 individuals, the results indicate that this species likely has a menstrual-type ovarian cycle. These data provide the first endocrine profile for the Alouatta caraya ovarian cycle and are similar to results obtained for other howler species. This similarity is important for comparative studies of howlers, allowing for a better understanding of their reproductive physiology and contributing to a critical information base for managing Alouatta species.

125,"A multiplex PCR protocol for rapid differential identification of four families of trematodes with medical and veterinary importance transmitted by Biomphalaria Preston, 1910 snails Trematodes have complex life cycles with multiple hosts. Biomphalaria snails commonly act as the first intermediate hosts of several species that can affect human and animal health. The specific identification of larval trematodes found in snails is difficult and limited, since the taxonomy of these flukes is based on morphological traits of the adults found in vertebrates. Despite recent advances worldwide, studies aiming at the use of molecular tools for the identification of cercariae found in snails are scarce in the South America. In fact, most studies are focused on Schistosoma mansoni, with few efforts directed towards the identification of larvae of other parasites found in planorbids. When reported, these other parasites are identified as cercarial types, an artificial morphological system of classification. Therefore, alternative strategies for a correct, rapid and inexpensive identification of larval trematodes found in Biomphalaria are needed. This work aimed at developing a methodology capable of distinguishing four important families of trematodes (Clinostomidae, Echinostomatidae, Schistosomatidae and Strigeidae) commonly found infecting species of Biomphalaria. Using the rDNA sequences of 34 species as input for the online tool TipMT, we designed trematode family-specific primers targeting the ITS region optimized to be used in multiplex PCR. The panel of primers identified in this study was effective at the same PCR condition. The specificity of the primers was confirmed, and the PCR sensitivity ranged from 0.1 ng to 1 ag of the DNA of the parasite. This methodology was also effective for the detection of coinfection. Through a simple, fast, accurate, and inexpensive methodology, it is possible to properly identify the trematode families included in this study in a single PCR reaction. A family level identification provides important information about probable hosts, pattern of life cycle and possible impacts that the infection generates in a specific region, thus allowing the design of better control strategies, especially for those infections that have medical and veterinary importance.

Firstly, the compounds were tested against promastigotes of four different Leishmania species. After that, all derivatives were assayed against L. braziliensis amastigotes and murine macrophages. Furthermore, it was investigated whether the antiamastigote L. braziliensis effect of the compounds could be associated with nitric oxide production. Compounds 6 and 7 showed a strong leishmanicidal activity against intracellular parasite with IC50 in nanogram levels (30 and 20 ng/mL, respectively).

128,"Ornithodoros cf. mimon infected with a spotted fever group Rickettsia in Brazil Ornithodoros mimon is an argasid tick primarily associated with bats that also infest other animals including birds, opossums and humans. In this paper, we report the finding of an argasid species resembling O. mimon, which similarly may be found in human dwellings and parasitize humans in Brazil. We also provide molecular evidence that this argasid tick species may carry a rickettsial organism, whose pathogenicity remains unknown. A total of 16 ticks (two females, two males and 12 nymphs) were collected in the bedroom and in the attic of a human house, where cases of insect bites have been recurrent. These ticks were identified morphologically and genetically as Ornithodoros cf. mimon. Upon PCR testing, four of these ticks (one female and three nymphs) were positive for human blood and for a bacterium closely related to Candidatus Rickettsia paranaensis. In conclusion, we report for the first time in Brazil an argasid tick species morphologically and genetically related to O. mimon, which feeds on humans and carry a rickettsial organism belonging to the spotted fever group. Further studies are needed to formally assess the taxonomic status of this tick species and also to investigate the pathogenicity of its associated rickettsial organism.

129,"Itraconazole versus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX): a comparative cohort study of 200 patients with paracoccidioidomycosis Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a systemic mycosis endemic to Latin America. Brazil accounts for approximately 80% of cases, where it represents a major public health issue due to its disabling impact and the number of premature deaths it causes. We present a retrospective cohort study that was conducted in order to better understand factors that relate to cure of the infection in the treatment of 200 patients with PCM. We evaluated the influence of sociodemographic and clinical factors as well as therapeutic regimen (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [TMP-SMX] and itraconazole) on the progress of PCM (cure and noncure). There was a higher incidence of cure (83%) among patients who regularly received treatment for their infections and completed the treatment protocol. Moreover, itraconazole (86.4%) was significantly superior to TMP-SMX (51.3%) in terms of cure rate and had a median treatment period that was significantly shorter (12 months) than that for TMP-SMX (23months). A Cox proportional hazard regression model showed that use of itraconazole increased the hazard of cure, regardless of sex, age, education, clinical form, completion of treatment, and regularity. Although the results of this study show that itraconazole was the best treatment option for PCM patients, a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial is necessary to confirm this conclusion. paracoccidioidomycosis,treatment,trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX),itraconazole Medical Mycology",Ciências da Saúde,Medicina,Clínica Médica,Ciências da Saúde,Medicina,Clínica Médica

This study aimed to assess the virulence of serial Sporothrix isolates from a 61-year-old male patient with chronic, destructive disseminated sporotrichosis. Five Sporothrix isolates were cultured from skin exudates and bone samples over a 5-year period, and all were molecularly identified as Sporothrix brasiliensis. The final isolate was significantly more virulent in Galleria mellonella larvae compared to earlier isolates. We conclude that S. brasiliensis has the capacity to increase in virulence in vivo. This finding is significant to clinicians caring for individuals with S. brasiliensis disease and it suggests that further studies are needed to identify the mechanisms underlying pathogenicity enhancement during chronic disease.

132,"Liver damage in schistosomiasis is reduced by adipose tissue-derived stem cell therapy after praziquantel treatment Author summary Schistosomiasis is the second most prevalent parasitic disease in the world and is caused by theSchistosomatrematode. This disease is characterized by a granulomatous reaction around parasite eggs trapped in the tissues. The liver is one of the most affected organs and can develop severe fibrosis. Praziquantel (PZQ) is the treatment for schistosomiasis and kills the adult the worm; however, inflammation still persists around the eggs in the tissues. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have been extensively studied as an alternative therapy to repair tissues and to stop inflammation due to their potential to differentiate in several cells types (bone, cartilage, fat, tendon, muscle, and marrow stroma), and to interfere with immune responses. This scenario has motivated the authors to investigate the use of MSC extract from adipose tissue (ASC) associated with PZQ to treat schistosomiasis. Briefly, mice were treated with PZQ followed by ASC injection showing significant reduction of the granulomas and normal levels of the enzyme alanine aminotransferase, an indicator of liver damage. These results suggest that ASC has the potential to be used as a novel therapeutic approach to control inflammation following infection byS.mansonior liver disorders. Although the findings are promising, further studies using the chronic model of schistosomiasis are required to confirm using ASC for schistosomiasis therapy. Background In view of the potential immunosuppressive and regenerative properties of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), we investigated whether transplantation of adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ASC) could be used to control the granulomatous reaction in the liver of mice infected withSchistosoma mansoniafter Praziquantel (PZQ) treatment. Methodology/Principal findings C57BL/6 mice infected withS.mansoniwere treated with PZQ and transplanted intravenously with ASC from uninfected mice. Liver morpho-physiological and immunological analyses were performed. The combined PZQ/ASC therapy significantly reduced the volume of hepatic granulomas, as well as liver damage as measured by ALT levels. We also observed that ASC accelerated the progression of the granulomatous inflammation to the advanced/curative phase. The faster healing interfered with the expression of CD28 and CTLA-4 molecules in CD4(+)T lymphocytes, and the levels of IL-10 and IL-17 cytokines, mainly in the livers of PZQ/ASC-treated mice. Conclusions Our results show that ASC therapy after PZQ treatment results in smaller granulomas with little tissue damage, suggesting the potential of ASC for the development of novel therapeutic approaches to minimize hepatic lesions as well as a granulomatous reaction followingS.mansoniinfection.

133,"Home-based exercise program in the indeterminate form of Chagas disease (PEDI-CHAGAS study): A study protocol for a randomized clinical trial Background: Chagas disease (CD) is a neglected endemic disease with worldwide impact due to migration. Approximately 50-70% of individuals in the chronic phase of CD present the indeterminate form, characterized by parasitological and/or serological evidence of Trypanosoma cruzi infection, but without clinical signs and symptoms. Subclinical abnormalities have been reported in indeterminate form of CD, including pro-inflammatory states and alterations in cardiac function, biomarkers and autonomic modulation. Moreover, individuals with CD are usually impacted on their personal and professional life, making social insertion difficult and impacting their mental health and quality of life (QoL). Physical exercise has been acknowledged as an important strategy to prevent and control numerous chronic-degenerative diseases, but unexplored in individuals with the indeterminate form of CD. The PEDI-CHAGAS study (which stands for Home-Based Exercise Program in the Indeterminate Form of Chagas Disease  in Portuguese) aims to evaluate the effects of a home-based exercise program on physical and mental health outcomes in individuals with indeterminate form of CD. Methods and design: The PEDI-CHAGAS is a two-arm (exercise and control) phase 3 superiority randomized clinical trial including patients with indeterminate form of CD. The exclusion criteria are < 18 years old, evidence of non-Chagasic cardiomyopathy, musculoskeletal or cognitive limitations that preclude the realization of exercise protocol, clinical contraindication for regular exercise, and regular physical exercise (>= 1 x per week). Participants will be assessed at baseline, and after three and 6 months of follow-up. The primary outcome will be QoL. Secondary outcomes will include blood pressure, physical fitness components, nutritional status, fatigability, autonomic modulation, cardiac morphology and function, low back pain, depression and anxiety, stress, sleep quality, medication use and adherence, and biochemical, inflammatory and cardiac biomarkers. Participants in the intervention group will undergo a home-based exercise program whilst those in the control group will receive only general information regarding the benefits of physical activity. Both groups will receive the same general nutritional counseling consisting of general orientations about healthy diets. Conclusion: The findings from the present study may support public health intervention strategies to improve physical and mental health parameters to be implemented more effectively in this population. physical activity,exercise training,mental health,fitness,Chagas disease,quality of life Frontiers in Medicine",Ciências da Saúde,Saúde Coletiva,Epidemiologia,Ciências da Saúde,Medicina,Clínica Médica

135,"Do men who have sex with men who report alcohol and illicit drug use before/during sex (chemsex) present moderate/high risk for substance use disorders? Drug Alcohol Depend; 209:107908, 2020 Background: We evaluated the prevalence of sexualized drug use (Chemsex) and its association with moderate/high risk for substance use disorders and HIV sexual risk behavior among men who have sex with men (MSM). Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional web-based survey among MSM from Rio de Janeiro (Brazil). The Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST) was used to screen people at moderate/high-risk for substance use disorders. Individuals found to be using substances in the prior three months were asked if they used before/during sex. Sexualized drug use was classified into: no sexualized drug use, sex using only alcohol (alcohol-sex), sex using only illicit drugs (drug-sex) and sex using alcohol and illicit drugs (alcohol-drug-sex). The questionnaire included questions about sociodemographic, HIV status/prevention and risk behavior. A multinomial regression model was performed to assess the factors associated with sexualized drug use. Results: Overall, 1048 MSM completed the questionnaire; median age was 29 years. Prevalence of alcohol and illicit drug use in previous 3 months was 89 % and 49 %, respectively. Most MSM (64 %) reported sexualized drug use: 28 % alcohol-sex, 9 % drug-sex and 27 % alcohol-drug-sex. Median ASSIST scores were higher among those reporting sexualized drug use compared to no use. All HIV sexual risk behavior variables presented increasing prevalence across the outcome categories. In the adjusted multivariate model, having moderate/high-risk for substance use disorders were associated with sexualized drug use. Conclusions: MSM reporting sexualized drug use should receive brief intervention for substance use disorders and be evaluated for combination HIV prevention strategies including PrEP.

136,"Harnessing mosquito-Wolbachia symbiosis for vector and disease control Mosquito species, members of the genera Aedes, Anopheles and Culex, are the major vectors of human pathogens including protozoa (Plasmodium sp.), filariae and of a variety of viruses (causing dengue, chikungunya, yellow fever, West Nile). There is lack of efficient methods and tools to treat many of the diseases caused by these major human pathogens, since no efficient vaccines or drugs are available; even in malaria where insecticide use and drug therapies have reduced incidence, 219 million cases still occurred in 2010. Therefore efforts are currently focused on the control of vector populations. Insecticides alone are insufficient to control mosquito populations since reduced susceptibility and even resistance is being observed more and more frequently. There is also increased concern about the toxic effects of insecticides on non-target (even beneficial) insect populations, on humans and the environment. During recent years, the role of symbionts in the biology, ecology and evolution of insect species has been well-documented and has led to suggestions that they could potentially be used as tools to control pests and therefore diseases. Wolbachia is perhaps the most renowned insect symbiont, mainly due to its ability to manipulate insect reproduction and to interfere with major human pathogens thus providing new avenues for pest control. We herein present recent achievements in the field of mosquito-Wolbachia symbiosis with an emphasis on Aedes albopictus. We also discuss how Wolbachia symbiosis can be harnessed for vector control as well as the potential to combine the sterile insect technique and Wolbachia-based approaches for the enhancement of population suppression programs.

137,"Variation Rhythms of Lymphocyte Subsets during Healthy Aging Immunological alterations associated with aging (immunosenescence) do not represent a simple unidirectional decline in all functions but develop as a complex remodeling of the immune system, involving multiple reorganization and developmentally regulated changes. In general, most data available about aging were obtained at particular age intervals and most of them come from Caucasian individuals from either Europe or the United States. Here, we report the frequencies of major lymphocyte subsets in healthy Brazilian individuals from 2 distinct geographic regions (Southeast and South) at several age intervals spanning a lifetime period (0-86 years). Overall, we demonstrated that changes in the frequencies of cells related to both innate and adaptive immunity clearly occur with aging in these individuals. These changes were not progressive and equally steady for all cell populations tested but instead showed an oscillatory or rhythmic behavior that was distinctive of each population at different age intervals. We also observed that abrupt changes in the frequencies of immune cells may occur in healthy individuals over 75 years old, suggesting there is an impaired flexibility of the immune system at late stages of life to sustain homeostasis via immune mechanisms. We presented reference ranges for healthy Brazilian individuals at all ages. The knowledge of these parameters in further detail will allow interventions to optimize immune function in advanced age and to improve the quality of life in the elderly. Copyright (C) 2008 S.

138,"The Role of Co-Stimulatory Molecules in Chagas Disease Chagas disease, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, is a potentially life-threatening tropical disease endemic to Latin American countries that affects approximately 8 million people. In the chronic phase of the disease, individuals are classified as belonging to the indeterminate clinical form or to the cardiac and/or digestive forms when clinical symptoms are apparent. The relationship between monocytes and lymphocytes may be an important point to help clarify the complexity that surrounds the clinical symptoms of the chronic phase of Chagas disease. The co-stimulatory signals are essential to determining the magnitude of T cell response to the antigen. The signals are known to determine the regulation of subsequent adaptive immune response. However, little is known about the expression and function of these molecules in Chagas disease. Therefore, this review aims to discuss the possible role of main pathways of co-stimulatory molecule-receptor interactions in this pathology that could be crucial to understand the disease dynamics.

140,"Differential expression profiles of miRNAs and their putative targets in Schistosoma mansoni during its life cycle BACKGROUND Schistosomiasis is a disease caused by Schistosoma. Due to its complex life cycle, evolutionary position and sexual dimorphism, schistosomes have several mechanisms of gene regulation. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short endogenous RNAs that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level by targeting mRNA transcripts. OBJECTIVES Here, we tested 12 miRNAs and identified their putative targets using a computational approach. METHODS We performed the expression profiles of a set of miRNAs and their putative targets during the parasite's life cycle by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). FINDINGS Our results showed differential expression patterns of the mature miRNAs sma-miR-250; sma-miR-92a; sma-miR-new_4-3p; sma-miR-new_4-5p; sma-miR-new_5-5p; sma-miR-new_12-5p; sma-miR-new_13-3p and sma-miR-new_13-5p. Interestingly, many of the putative target genes are linked to oxidative phosphorylation and are up-regulated in adult-worms, which led us to suggest that miRNAs might play important roles in the post-transcriptional regulation of genes related to energetic metabolism inversion during parasite development. It is noteworthy that the expression of sma-miR-new_13-3p exhibited a negative correlation on SmNADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex I. MAIN CONCLUSIONS Our analysis revealed putative miRNA genes related to important biological processes, such as transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) signaling, proteasome regulation, glucose and lipid metabolism, immune system evasion and transcriptional regulation.; BACKGROUND Schistosomiasis is a disease caused by Schistosoma.

141,"Factors associated with the reporting of child and adolescent abuse in primary healthcare This study aimed to analyze factors associated with the reporting of child and adolescent abuse in primary healthcare. It is a cross-sectional study conducted with 381 professionals (physicians, nurses and dental surgeons) from three healthcare regions of the state of Ceara, Brazil. It used a self-administered questionnaire asking for socio-demographic data, vocational education and training, instrumentation and knowledge on the issue, identification and reporting of abuse cases. Bivariate and multivariate analyses using logistic regression were performed. There was a frequency of 17% of abuse reporting by basic healthcare professionals. The multivariate analysis showed that participating in the training on the issue (OR = 2.18; CI95% = 1.05–4.53), being familiar with the reporting form (OR = 3.03; CI95% = 1.47–6.24) and knowing how to refer the case properly (OR = 2.55; CI95% = 1.01–6.43) increased the chance of professionals reporting child and adolescent abuse. The variables identified in the final model showed a direct association between the act of reporting and matters related to knowledge and training on the issue.

142,"Adolescer com deficiência mental: a ótica dos pais The purpose of this paper was to understand the meaning adolescence has for parents of adolescents with mental disability. The methodology used was the narrative analysis according to the guidelines of Thompson (1998) and Byron-Good (1996). Although the parents identified some typical characteristics of adolescence in their children, not always they did in fact consider them adolescents due to their lack of autonomy. Quite often the parents did not meet the family life education needs of their disabled children helping them to become more independent. The lack of information about how to act in face of the behavioral changes involved in adolescence was a source of resentment. In view of the importance of greater autonomy, actions should be developed to help these adolescents recognize this stage of human development and to live this period the best way possible. When- mentally disabled adolescents are given the opportunity to improve their competences and abilities and to expand their  horizon , they will be able to become more autonomous and able to live all stages of life in a satisfactory way.

The assessment was based on an extensive and systematic review using bibliographic databases available online and a review of projects by research groups. Brazilian research groups were identified using the database of the Brazilian National Research Council (CNPq). A geographic information system was used to determine the location of the studies. Different aspects of mercury contamination were evaluated (environmental studies, impacts on human health, technological improvements). For 1990-2005, a total of 455 publications were identified. The main advances and remaining gaps in relation to environmental issues and human health were identified and discussed. Although the scientific output varied considerably over the period, there was a general increase in the total number of publications per year from the early 1990s (fewer than 20) until 2005 (more than 30), considering the articles published in indexed journals.

144,"Willingness to Take Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis (MDR-TB) Preventive Therapy among Adult and Adolescent Household Contacts of MDR-TB Index Cases: An International Multi-Site Cross-Sectional Study Background. Household contacts (HHCs) of individuals with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) are at high risk of infection and subsequent disease. There is limited evidence on the willingness of MDR-TB HHCs to take MDR-TB preventive therapy (MDR TPT) to decrease their risk of TB disease. Methods. In this cross-sectional study of HHCs of MDR-TB and rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (RR-TB) index cases from 16 clinical research sites in 8 countries, enrollees were interviewed to assess willingness to take a hypothetical, newly developed MDR TPT if offered. To identify factors associated with willingness to take MDR TPT, a marginal logistic model was fitted using generalized estimating equations to account for household-level clustering. Results. From 278 MDR-TB/RR-TB index case households, 743 HHCs were enrolled; the median age of HHCs was 33 (interquartile range, 22-49) years, and 62% were women. HHC willingness to take hypothetical MDR TPT was high (79%) and remained high even with the potential for mild side effects (70%). Increased willingness was significantly associated with current employment or schooling (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.83 [95% confidence interval CI, 1.07-3.13]), appropriate TB-related knowledge (aOR, 2.22 [95% CI, 1.23-3.99]), confidence in taking MDR TPT (aOR, 7.16 [95% CI, 3.33-15.42]), and being comfortable telling others about taking MDR TPT (aOR, 2.29 [95% CI, 1.29-4.06]). Conclusions. The high percentage of HHCs of MDR-TB/RR-TB index cases willing to take hypothetical MDR TPT provides important evidence for the potential uptake of effective MDR TPT when implemented. Identified HHC-level variables associated with willingness may inform education and counseling efforts to increase HHC confidence in and uptake of MDR TPT. tuberculosis,contacts,drug resistance,prophylaxis,preventive therapy Clinical Infectious Diseases",Ciências da Saúde,Medicina,Clínica Médica,Ciências da Saúde,Medicina,Clínica Médica
145,"Violacein-Induced Chaperone System Collapse Underlies Multistage Antiplasmodial Activity Antimalarial drugs with novel modes of action and wide therapeutic potential are needed to pave the way for malaria eradication. Violacein is a natural compound known for its biological activity against cancer cells and several pathogens, including the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum (Pf). Herein, using chemical genomic profiling (CGP), we found that violacein affects protein homeostasis. Mechanistically, violacein binds Pf chaperones, Pf Hsp90 and Pf Hsp70-1, compromising the latter's ATPase and chaperone activities. Additionally, violacein-treated parasites exhibited increased protein unfolding and proteasomal degradation. The uncoupling of the parasite stress response reflects the multistage growth inhibitory effect promoted by violacein. Despite evidence of proteotoxic stress, violacein did not inhibit global protein synthesis via UPR activation-a process that is highly dependent on chaperones, in agreement with the notion of a violacein-induced proteostasis collapse. Our data highlight the importance of a functioning chaperone-proteasome system for parasite development and differentiation. Thus, a violacein-like small molecule might provide a good scaffold for development of a novel probe for examining the molecular chaperone network and/or antiplasmodial drug design. malaria,chaperone inhibitor,chemogenomics,violacein,proteostasis ACS INFECTIOUS DISEASES",Ciências Biológicas,Microbiologia,Biologia e Fisiologia dos Microorganismos,Ciências Biológicas,Farmacologia,Farmacologia Bioquímica e Molecular

This study, using the technique of Graham (1941), evaluated the presence of intestinal helminth eggs in samples collected from surfaces and objects of two airport terminals in Minas Gerais: Carlos Drummond de Andrade (Pampulha), in Belo Horizonte, and Tancredo Neves in Confins. The interior of the airports was divided into three large areas: (1) common, (2) boarding and disembarking, and (3) restricted to employees, in addition to one aircraft. The collections were carried out in 2013. All slides were analyzed using a binocular microscope at 10X and 40X magnifications, by the technical team of the Research Group in Helminthology and Medical Malacology of the René Rachou Research Center (Fiocruz-Minas) in Belo Horizonte. The results indicated the absence of eggs on all surfaces and objects examined. Based on the results, it can be inferred that maintenance, regular cleaning and disinfection of the environments of the two airports were the main causes of the negative results of the tests.

It is known that its pathogenesis involves a dysfunction in the major histocompatibity complex associated with environment factors, in genetically susceptible people. The destruction of β cells is mediated by T and B cells, NK cells and APCs infiltration in the islets of Langerhans, leading to low production of insulin and high glucose blood levels. On the other hand, helminth infections are described as modulators of inflammatory responses due to their capacity to strongly induce Th2 and Treg immune responses. Some studies on autoimmunity diseases, in experimental models and clinical trials, have shown an immune modulation by helminths infections. In this study, we investigated whether Necator americanus crude extract interferes in autoimmune experimental diabetes. © 2021, Research Trends (P) LTD.. All rights reserved.

This is a qualitative, descriptive study that draws on semi-structured interviews with hospital administrators. Data analysis used the Collective Subject Discourse approach. Managers believe this process is the result of a set of emerging strategies, proposals and need for change, which result in adaptive reactions that hospitals develop with no coordination between them to resolve problems identified by professionals and managers. The process is analyzed much more from a political point of view than from a rational and systemic one. Some of the experience with the hospital mission, such as the focus on a strategic approach, already signals a more collegiate approach to defining the profile of care, where the hospital is one component of an integrated network of services, with a decision process that is less incremental and more integrating.

153,"Solidagenone from Solidago chilensis Meyen inhibits skin inflammation in experimental models Solidagenone (SOL) is a labdane-type diterpenoid found in Solidago chilensis, a plant traditionally used to treat skin diseases, kidney pain and ovarian inflammation. In this study, the topical anti-inflammatory activity of SOL was evaluated using in vivo and in silico assays. Croton oil-, arachidonic acid (AA)- and phenol-induced ear oedema mouse models were applied in the in vivo studies. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) and N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) activities and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and nitric oxide (NO) levels were determined, as well as histopathological analyses were conducted. Interaction profiles between SOL and cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), glucocorticoid receptor, estradiol-17-β-dehydrogenase and prostaglandin-E(2)-9-reductase were established using molecular docking. SOL significantly inhibited croton oil-, AA- and phenol-induced ear oedema (P <.001) at doses of 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 mg/ear. The MPO and NAG activities and TNF-α, IL-6 and NO levels were decreased (P <.001). The histopathological data revealed that inflammatory parameters (oedema thickness, leucocyte infiltration and vasodilatation) were reduced by treatment with SOL at doses of 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 mg/ear.

155,"Zika virus RNA persistence and recovery in water and wastewater: An approach for Zika virus surveillance in resource-constrained settings During the 2015-2016 Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic in the Americas, serological cross-reactivity with other fla-viviruses and relatively high costs of nucleic acid testing in the region hindered the capacity for widespread diagnostic testing. In such cases where individual testing is not feasible, wastewater monitoring approaches may offer a means of community-level public health surveillance. To inform such approaches, we characterized the persistence and recovery of ZIKV RNA in experiments where we spiked cultured ZIKV into surface water, wastewater, and a combination of both to examine the potential for detection in open sewers serving commu-nities most affected by the ZIKV outbreak, such as those in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil. We used reverse transcription droplet digital PCR to quantify ZIKV RNA. In our persistence experiments, we found that the persistence of ZIKV RNA decreased with increasing temperature, significantly decreased in surface water versus wastewater, and significantly decreased when the initial concentration of virus was lowered by one order of magnitude. In our recovery experiments, we found higher percent recovery of ZIKV RNA in pellets versus supernatants from the same sample, higher recoveries in pellets using skimmed milk flocculation, lower recoveries of ZIKV RNA in surface water versus wastewater, and lower recoveries from a freeze thaw. We also analyzed samples collected from Salvador, Brazil during the ZIKV outbreak (2015-2016) that consisted of archived samples obtained from open sewers or environmental waters thought to be contaminated by sewage. Although we did not detect any ZIKV RNA in the archived Brazil samples, results from these persistence and recovery experiments serve to inform future wastewater monitoring efforts in open sewers, an understudied and important application of wastewater monitoring.

156,"Overexpression of eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (eIF5A) affects susceptibility to benznidazole in Trypanosoma cruzi populations Eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (eIF5A) is a conserved protein with an essential role in translation elongation. Using one and two-dimensional western blotting, we showed that the eIF5A protein level was 2-fold lower in benznidazole (BZ)-resistant (B7R and 17LER) Trypanosoma cruzi populations than in their respective susceptible counterparts (BZS and 17WTS). To confirm the role of eIF5A in BZ resistance, we transfected BZS and 17WTS with the wild-type eIF5A or mutant eIF5A-S2A (in which serine 2 was replaced by alanine). Upon overexpressing eIF5A, both susceptible lines became approximately 3- and 5-fold more sensitive to BZ. In contrast, the eIF5A-S2A mutant did not alter its susceptibility to BZ. These data suggest that BZ resistance might arise from either decreasing the translation of proteins that require eIF5A, or as a consequence of differential levels of precursors for the hypusination reactions (e.g., spermidine and trypanothione), both of which alter BZ's effects in the parasite.; Eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (eIF5A) is a conserved protein with an essential role in translation elongation.

157,"A systematic scoping review of the genetic ancestry of the Brazilian population The genetic background of Brazilian population is mainly characterized by three parental populations: European, African and Native American. The aim of this study is to overview the genetic ancestry estimates for different Brazilian geographic regions and analyzed factors involved in these estimates. In a systematic scoping review were included fifty-one studies, comprehending 81 populations of 19 states from five regions of Brazil. To reduce the potential bias of studies with different sampling, we calculated the mean of genetic ancestry weighted by the number of individuals. The weighted mean proportions of European, African and Native American ancestries were 68.1%, 19.6% and 11.6%, respectively. At the regional level, the highest European contribution occurred in the South, while the highest African and Native American contributions occurred in the Northeastern and Northern regions, respectively. Among states in the Northeast region, Bahia and Ceará showed significant differences among them, suggesting distinct demographic histories.

158,"Effect of secondary infection on epithelialisation and total healing of cutaneous leishmaniasis lesions BACKGROUND Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) generally presents with a single or several localised cutaneous ulcers without involvement of mucous membranes. Ulcerated lesions are susceptible to secondary contamination that may slow the healing process. OBJECTIVE This study verified the influence of non-parasitic wound infection on wound closure (epithelialisation) and total healing. METHODS Twenty-five patients with a confirmed diagnosis of CL and ulcerated lesions underwent biopsy of ulcer borders. One direct microbial parameter (germ identification in cultures) and four indirect clinical parameters (secretion, pain, burning sensation, pruritus) were analysed. FINDINGS Biopsies of ten lesions showed secondary infection by one or two microorganisms (Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes and Candida parapsilosis). Secretion and burning sensation influenced epithelialisation time but not total healing time. Positive detection of germs in the ulcer border and pain and pruritus revealed no influence on wound closure. CONCLUSIONS Our borderline proof of clinical CL ulcer infection inhibiting CL wound healing supports the need to follow antimicrobial stewardship in CL ulcer management, which was recently proposed for all chronic wounds. cutaneous leishmaniasis,wound infection,opportunistic infection Memórias do Instituto Oswaldo Cruz",Ciências da Saúde,Medicina,Clínica Médica,Ciências da Saúde,Medicina,Clínica Médica
159,"Prevalence of Obesity in Brazilian Air Force Military Personnel and its Implications for Aerospace Medicine This study aimed to review the main aspects of obesity and its implications for aerospace medicine. The databases of the Aerospace Medicine Center (CEMAL) for 2005 and the Air Force Sports Commission (CDA) for 2008 were searched. It is important to highlight that 53% of the Military Organizations (OM) sent the tests to the CDA. It was found that 45.5% of the individuals evaluated in the Physical Fitness Assessment Test (TACF) were overweight (Body Mass Index – BMI > 25). Of the military airmen examined at CEMAL, 8.1% were obese. The results presented reinforce the importance of regularly performing anthropometric measurements during health inspections and clinical examinations. In conclusion, it was suggested that a weight control program be developed to promote health among FAB military personnel, if relevant changes in BMI and abdominal circumference are identified in the TACF, as well as new studies with larger and multi-year samples.

160,"Crystal structure of Staphylococcus aureus exfoliative toxin D-like protein: Structural basis for the high specificity of exfoliative toxins Exfoliative toxins are serine proteases secreted by Staphylococcus aureus that are associated with toxin-mediated staphylococcal syndromes. To date, four different serotypes of exfoliative toxins have been identified and 3 of them (ETA, ETB, and ETD) are linked to human infection. Among these toxins, only the ETD structure remained unknown, limiting our understanding of the structural determinants for the functional differentiation between these toxins. We recently identified an ETD-like protein associated to S. aureus strains involved in mild mastitis in sheep. The crystal structure of this ETD-like protein was determined at 1.95 Å resolution and the structural analysis provide insights into the oligomerization, stability and specificity and enabled a comprehensive structural comparison with ETA and ETB. Despite the highly conserved molecular architecture, significant differences in the composition of the loops and in both the N- and C-terminal α-helices seem to define ETD-like specificity. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that these regions defining ET specificity present different degrees of flexibility and may undergo conformational changes upon substrate recognition and binding. DLS and AUC experiments indicated that the ETD-like is monomeric in solution whereas it is present as a dimer in the asymmetric unit indicating that oligomerization is not related to functional differentiation among these toxins. Differential scanning calorimetry and circular dichroism assays demonstrated an endothermic transition centered at 52°C, and an exothermic aggregation in temperatures up to 64°C. All these together provide insights about the mode of action of a toxin often secreted in syndromes that are not associated with either ETA or ETB. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

161,"Persistence of Yellow fever virus outside the Amazon Basin, causing epidemics in Southeast Brazil, from 2016 to 2018 Background Yellow fever (YF) is endemic in the Brazilian Amazon Basin, and sporadic outbreaks take place outside the endemic area in Brazil. Since 2016, YF epidemics have been occurring in Southeast Brazil, with more than 1,900 human cases and more than 1,600 epizooties of non-human primates (NHPs) reported until April 2018. Previous studies have demonstrated that Yellow fever virus (YFV) causing outbreaks in 2017 formed a monophyletic group. Methodology/Principal findings Aiming to decipher the origin of the YFV responsible for the recent epidemics, we obtained nucleotide sequences of YFV detected in humans (n = 6) and NHPs (n = 10) from Minas Gerais state during 2017 +/- 2018. Next, we performed evolutionary analyses and discussed the results in the light of epidemiological records (official numbers of YFV cases at each Brazilian Federative unit, reported by the Brazilian Ministry of Health). Nucleotide sequences of YFV from Southeast Brazil from 2016 to 2018 were highly conserved and formed a monophyletic lineage (BR-YFV_2016/18) within the genotype South America I. Different clusters were observed within lineage BR-YFV_2016/18, one containing the majority of isolates (from humans and NHPs), indicating the sylvatic transmission of YFV. We also detected a cluster characterized by two synapomorphies (amino acid substitutions) that contained YFV only associated with NHP what should be further investigated. The topology of lineage BRYFV_2016/18 was congruent with epidemiological and temporal patterns of the ongoing epidemic. YFV isolates detected in 2016, in Sao Paulo state were located in the most basal position of the lineage, followed by the isolates from Minas Gerais and Esp oA rito Santo obtained in 2017 and 2018. The most recent common ancestor of the lineage BRYFV_2016/18 dated to 2015 (95% credible intervals = 2014 +/- 2016), in a period that was coincident with the reemergence of YFV in the Midwest region of Brazil. Conclusions The results demonstrated a single introduction of YFV in the Southeast region and the silent viral circulation before the onset of the outbreaks in 2016. Evolutionary analyses combined with epidemiological records supported the idea that BR- YFV_2016/18 was probably introduced from the Midwest into the Southeast region, possibly in Sao Paulo state. The persistence of YFV in the Southeast region, causing epidemics from 2016 to 2018, suggests that this region presents suitable ecological and climatic conditions for YFV maintenance during the epidemic and interepidemic seasons. This fact poses risks for the establishing of YF enzootic cycles and epidemics, outside the Amazon Basin in Brazil. YF surveillance and studies of viral dynamics deserve particular attention, especially in Midwest, Southeast and neighbor regions which are the main areas historically associated with YF outbreaks outside the Amazon Basin.

A cross-sectional study was carried out with 1,209 postpartum women residing in the region, admitted to the SUS for childbirth in 2010 and 2011. Data were collected on prenatal medical-dental care, the impact of oral health on quality of life (Oral Health Impact Profile-14), and contextual, predisposing, and enabling characteristics. Prenatal dental care was adequate when the care provided corresponded to the recommended treatment. The likelihood of adequate prenatal dental care was analyzed using a multivariate logistic model. It was found that oral health impacted the quality of life of 102 (8.4%) pregnant women and the adequacy of prenatal dental care was only 15.4% (n=156). There was a greater likelihood of adequate prenatal dental care in Vitória (OR=2.44; CI=1.63-3.66), in the presence of the Family Health Strategy (OR=1.88; CI=1.22-2.89) and quality prenatal care (OR=3.59; CI=1.64-7.84).

164,"Unbalanced networks and disturbed kinetics of serum soluble mediators associated with distinct disease outcomes in severe COVID-19 patients The present study applied distinct models of descriptive analysis to explore the integrative networks and the kinetic timeline of serum soluble mediators to select a set of systemic biomarkers applicable for the clinical management of COVID-19 patients. For this purpose, a total of 246 participants (82 COVID-19 and 164 healthy controls - HC) were enrolled in a prospective observational study. Serum soluble mediators were quantified by high-throughput microbeads array on hospital admission (D0) and at consecutive timepoints (D1-6 and D7-20). The results reinforce that the COVID-19 group exhibited a massive storm of serum soluble mediators. While increased levels of CCL3 and G-CSF were associated with the favorable prognosis of non-mechanical ventilation (nMV) or discharge, high levels of CXCL10 and IL-6 were observed in patients progressing to mechanical ventilation (MV) or death. At the time of admission, COVID-19 patients presented a complex and robust serum soluble mediator network, with a higher number of strong correlations involving IFN-γ, IL-1Ra and IL-9 observed in patients progressing to MV or death. Multivariate regression analysis demonstrates the ability of serum soluble mediators to cluster COVID-19 from HC. Ascendant fold change signatures and the kinetic timeline analysis further confirmed that the pairs CCL3 and G-CSF and CXCL10 and IL-6 were associated with favorable or poor prognosis, respectively.

This is a cross-sectional study with data from 8,083 adults from the National Health Survey (PNS, 2014/15). Salt consumption was based on the estimated 24-hour urinary sodium excretion, calculated by the sodium/creatinine ratio in a casual urine sample. The highest quartile of the distribution was considered high consumption. The relationship between high salt consumption and sociodemographic factors, lifestyle, morbidity, and self-rated health status was analyzed by calculating the crude prevalence ratios and those adjusted for age and sex. 28.1% had an estimated salt consumption greater than 10.56 g/day. The presence of overweight (adjusted prevalence ratio; 95%CI - RPaj 1.23; 1.09-1.39), obesity (RPaj 1.61; 1.43-1.83) and diabetes (RPaj 1.36; 1.17-1.58) were positively associated with high salt intake. The following were protective factors: female gender (RPaj 0.73; 0.66-0.80), high level of education (RPaj 0.88; 0.79-0.99), living in the North region and presence of chronic kidney disease (RPaj 0.71; 0.56-0.90).

Vaccinated animals produced significantly increased levels of total IgG and IgG2, but not lgG1 anti-A2 antibodies, and remained negative in conventional leishmaniasis serodiagnostic methods. Significantly increased IFN-gamma and low IL-10 levels were detected in vaccinated animals before and after challenge, as compared to control animals. Importantly, while the symptoms onset appeared as early as three months after infection in most control dogs, 14 months after challenge, 5 out of 7 vaccinated dogs remained asymptomatic.

Assuming negative binomial distributions for the parasite counts, we rank the statistical power of three measures of efficacy: ratio of mean parasite intensity at the end of the trial, the odds ratio of infection at the end of the trial, and the rate ratio of incidence of infection during the trial. We also use a modelling approach to estimate the likely impact of trial interventions on the force of infection, and hence statistical power. We conclude that (1) final mean parasite intensity is a suitable endpoint for later phase vaccine trials, and (2) mass effects of trial interventions are unlikely to appreciably reduce the force of infection in the community - and hence statistical power - unless there is a combination of high vaccine efficacy and a large proportion of the population enrolled.

169,"Recombinant micro-exon gene 3 (MEG-3) antigens from Schistosoma mansoni failed to induce protection against infection but show potential for serological diagnosis Sequence databases on Schistosoma mansoni have revealed micro-exon gene (MEGs) families. Many of these genes are highly expressed in parasite life cycle stages associated with the mammalian host infection and appear to be involved in immune evasion by schistosomes. So, we believe that MEG-coding proteins would make potential candidates for vaccine development or diagnosis for schistosomiasis. Here, we study MEG-3.2 and MEG-3.4, members of the MEG-3 family. Recombinant (r) proteins were produced and formulated with Freund's adjuvant for vaccination of mice. Immunization with recombinant MEG-3.2 or MEG-3.4 formulation generated high levels of IgG1 antibodies. Additionally, vaccination also induced a mixed Th1/Th2/Th17-type of response, since IFN-gamma, IL-5 and IL-17 cytokines were detected in the supernatant of spleen cell cultures; however it failed to induce reduction in parasitic worm burden. Finally, the recombinant proteins were evaluated in a serological assay using human samples. Schistosome-infected individuals showed higher levels of both IgG and IgM against rMEG-3.2 compared to non-infected individuals, while only IgM anti-rMEG-3.4 antibodies were elevated in infected patients. Therefore, between both studied molecules, MEG-3.2 protein is the antigen that shows potential to compose a serological diagnosis test for schistosomiasis.

Knowing that AK is influenced by solar radiation and that to our knowledge there are no clinical and histological data on this lesion in the Northeast of Brazil, the present study analyzed a series of 35 cases of AK in the population of this Brazilian region. The slides corresponding to each case were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and analyzed by light microscopy, and the morphological aspects of the lesions were described. Clinical data were obtained from the request forms for the anatomopathological examination. Of the 35 cases in our sample, 60 percent were male. The mean age was 54.6 years. Most patients were leucoderma. The AK lesions were characterized by stratified squamous epithelium exhibiting variable degrees of keratinization. Solar elastosis was present in all cases. Regarding the degree of dysplasia, 17 cases presented mild dysplasia, 13 had moderate dysplasia, and 5 had severe dysplasia. Although the cases in this study presented epithelial dysplasia, these were not severe enough to generate an invasive neoplasia. However, it is important that studies of this nature be carried out in other regions of the country so that public policies can be established to prevent the appearance and malignancy of these lesions.

171,"Infrastructure is a necessary but insufficient condition to eliminate inequalities in access to water: Research of a rural community intervention in Northeast Brazil Given the importance of reducing diverse forms of inequality in access to water, highlighted both in the framework of the Human Right to Water (HRW) and in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), this work assesses conditions of access to water and related inequalities before and after the construction of a Water Supply System (WSS) in a rural community of Brazil's semi-arid region. A quasi-experimental study was performed to assess the conditions of access to water for study and control groups (amounting to 380 households). The methodology encompassed two phases, one prior and another subsequent to the construction of a WSS in the study community. The analytical framework of the HRW was applied, specifically the normative content regarding quality, accessibility and availability. The case study's findings help to evidence the limitations and challenges of merely infrastructure-related measures to improve access to water. The construction of a new WSS in the studied community was an improvement as it provided water of good quality to the beneficiary households, which entailed a decreased or even a no-longer-existing need to collect water for children and adolescents. However, certain problems persisted, such as the continued practice of collecting water and the use, by certain families, of water that was fecally contaminated. In a different perspective, the WSS made it possible to increase the per capita volume of water consumed by families and to reduce inequalities associated with this aspect. Meanwhile, the research reveals the possible limits of the WSS in ensuring that higher volumes of water will be consumed per capita, especially among households without intra-household water distribution infrastructure.; Given the importance of reducing diverse forms of inequality in access to water, highlighted both in the framework of the Human Right to Water (HRW) and in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), this work assesses conditions of access to water and related inequalities before and after the construction of a Water Supply System (WSS) in a rural community of Brazil's semi-arid region.

Yet it is challenging to understand learning in this context. How does it actually influence the learning process? This article stems from research on how a visit to a science museum may contribute to shaping the health concepts held by young people. The results identify the context of the museum as an environment favorable to meaningful learning and how meanings are grasped from the content explored during activities. Another important aspect of learning for these young people was the exploration of topics like the history of health, the relation between health and environment, science as a human product, and the role of the scientist within society. education at museums,meaningful learning,history of health,health and environment,science and society História, Ciência, Saúde - Manguinhos",Ciências Sociais Aplicadas,Museologia,,Ciências Humanas,Educação,Planejamento e Avaliação Educacional
174,"A case of sporotrichosis caused by different Sporothrix brasiliensis strains: mycological, molecular, and virulence analyses BACKGROUND Sporotrichosis is a subcutaneous mycosis caused by dimorphic pathogenic fungi belonging to the Sporothrix genus. Pathogenic Sporothrix species typically produce melanin, which is known to be a virulence factor. OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to perform phenotypic, genotypic, and virulence analyses of two distinct Sporothrix brasiliensis strains isolated from the same lesion on a patient from Rio de Janeiro. METHODS AND FINDINGS Genotypic analyses by partial sequencing of the calmodulin, beta-tubulin, and chitin synthase genes, as well as polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-fingerprinting by T3B, M13, and GACA, showed that the isolates were very similar but not identical. Both isolates had similar phenotypic characteristics and effectively produced melanin in their yeast forms, accounting for their ability of causing disease in a murine sporotrichosis model. Remarkably, isolate B was albino in its environmental form but caused more severe disease than the pigmented A isolate. CONCLUSIONS These findings indicate that the patient was infected by two genetically and biologically distinct S. brasiliensis that vary in their production of melanin in their environmental forms. The results underscore the importance of characterizing phenotypically different isolates found in the same clinical specimen or patient.

175,"Backlash in global health and the end of AIDS' exceptionalism in Brazil, 2007-2019 This paper examines the decline of the AIDS Programme in Brazil, the Latin American country most affected by the epidemic, with emphasis in the second decade of the twenty-first century. For many years, Brazil served as a model in Global Health due to a comprehensive preventive policy, a partnership between the government and health activists and the support of life-saving drugs as public goods rather than commodities. The regression of AIDS policies in Brazil interacted with developments in the United States as well as with multilateral agencies like UNAIDS that emphasised biomedicalisation in the response to the disease where broad human-rights programmes and alliance with activists were not priorities. International programmes like the 'Ending AIDS' campaign indirectly undermined the exceptional status AIDS enjoyed since the late 1980s. The backlash in Brazilian policies to fight AIDS was a result of the fragmentation of the left and the empowerment of radical conservative authoritarian and religious forces. The result was the breakdown of the long-held belief that successful anti-AIDS disease programmes could simultaneously help control the disease and build better healthcare systems and ultimately prompted the end of the special place AIDS' policy had in Brazil.

176,"Spatial modeling of leprosy in the state of Bahia, Brazil, (2001-2015) and social determinants of health This work analyzes the spatial distribution of leprosy in Bahia and associated social determinants. It is an ecological study, with leprosy data from 2001-2015. Three epidemiological indicators were selected: coefficient of detection in the general population and in children under 15 and the rate of new cases with grade II physical disability. These indicators were flattened by the Local Empirical Bayesian Model and Global and Local Moran statistics were applied. The independent variables were selected from the IBGE-2010 Census. Multivariate regressions were employed, followed by spatial regression. Leprosy exhibited a heterogeneous distribution in the state, with concentration in the north-west axis and the south region. For the general detection coefficient, five variables composed the final model: demographic density, urban population proportion, per capita income, proportion of extremely poor and households with over three people per dormitory. The illiteracy proportion made up the final model for the grade II rate of physical disability. No determinants of the occurrence of the disease were identified in children under 15. The modeling used contributed to demonstrate the spatial heterogeneity and social determinants of the disease in Bahia, revealing the complexity of the problem.

178,"A pilot and open trial to evaluate topical Bacterial Cellulose bio-curatives in the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by L. braziliensis The treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) in Brazil using pentavalent antimony (Sb-v) is associated with a high failure rate and long time to heal. Moreover, standard Sbv treatment cures only 50-60% of the cases. In this pilot clinical trial, we evaluated the topical use of bacterial cellulose (BC) bio-curatives + Sb-v in the treatment of CL caused by L. braziliensis, in Bahia, Brazil. A total of 20 patients were randomized in two groups assigned to receive either parenteral Sb-v alone or parenteral Sb-v plus topically applied BC bio-curatives. CL patients treated with Sb-v + topical BC bio-curatives had a significantly higher cure rate at 60 days post initiation of treatment compared to CL patients treated with Sb-v alone (P=0.01). At day 90 post initiation of treatment, cure rate was similar in the two groups as was overall healing time. Adverse effects or local reactions to topical BC application were not observed. This pilot trial shows that the potential use of a combined therapy consisting of topical BC bio-curatives and parenteral Sbv in favoring healing of CL lesions caused by L. braziliensis, at an early time point.

179,"Evaluation of Amazon fruits: chemical and nutritional studies on Borojoa sorbilis BACKGROUND: Borojoa sorbilis (Ducke) is an Amazonian species with edible fruits that are widely consumed by the local population, but little studied and not yet economically explored. Thus the aim of this study was to describe the chemical composition, volatile compounds, nutritional aspects and antioxidant activity of the fruit pulp and peel of B. sorbilis. RESULTS: Headspace solid-phase microextraction, using polydimethylsiloxane–divinylbenzene (PDMS-DVB) fiber, resulted in the identification of 59 substances in the pulp and peel of B. sorbilis fruits after analysis of the chromatograms obtained by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry using polar and nonpolar columns. Esters were the most abundant. Moisture, lipids, protein, dietary fiber, ash, carbohydrate, total energy value, titratable acid, soluble solids and pH were measured. Protein amount, fat content and antioxidant activity were low in both pulp and peel. Carbohydrate content was 179.2 and 134.9 g kg−1 in pulp and peel, respectively. CONCLUSION: This is the first report on the chemical characteristics, flavor and nutritional aspects of B. sorbilis fruit, which is essential to its economic exploitation. The high energy value associated with the carbohydrate content, plus the low fat content, contribute to a possible use of B. sorbilis fruits as a food supplement. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry GC–MS; headspace SPME; nutritional; Rubiaceae; tropical fruit Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture",Ciências da Saúde,Farmácia,Farmacognosia,Ciências Agrárias,Ciência e Tecnologia de Alimentos,Ciência de Alimentos

181,"Characterization of clinical patterns of dengue patients using an unsupervised machine learning approach BackgroundDespite the greater sensitivity of the new dengue clinical classification proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2009, there is a need for a better definition of warning signs and clinical progression of dengue cases. Classic statistical methods have been used to evaluate risk criteria in dengue patients, however they usually cannot access the complexity of dengue clinical profiles. We propose the use of machine learning as an alternative tool to identify the possible characteristics that could be used to develop a risk criterion for severity in dengue patients.MethodIn this study, we analyzed the clinical profiles of 523 confirmed dengue cases using self-organizing maps (SOM) and random forest algorithms to identify clusters of patients with similar patterns.ResultsWe identified four natural clusters, two with features of dengue without warning signs or mild disease, one that comprises the severe dengue cases and high frequency of warning signs, and another with intermediate characteristics. Age appeared as the key variable for splitting the data into these four clusters although warning signs such as abdominal pain or tenderness, clinical fluid accumulation, mucosal bleeding, lethargy, restlessness, liver enlargement and increased hematocrit associated with a decrease in platelet counts should also be considered to evaluate severity in dengue patients.ConclusionsThese findings suggest that age must be the first characteristic to be considered in places where dengue is hyperendemic. Our results show that warning signs should be closely monitored, mainly in children. Further studies exploring these results in a longitudinal approach may help to understand the full spectrum of dengue clinical manifestations.

183,"The sustainable health Agenda in the Americas: Pre-pandemic gaps and 2030 estimates of the SDGs indicators The preliminary assessments of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic have recently rekindled worries about the feasibility of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Notwithstanding the concern voiced by key academic and political actors, the actual evidence on the current gaps and distance from the goals is still very much unknown. This study estimates the global evolution curves for each health-related SDGs indicator in the World Health Organization’s SDGs platform. These curves synthesize the transnational trends at play in the evolution of each health-related topic, offering an average global counterfactual to compare with the actual information for each country. The empirical investigation focuses on the American continent, highlighting the health gaps before the COVID-19 outbreak in 33 countries of the region. The study also extrapolates these trends to predict the evolution of the health-related SDGs in each of these countries over the next decade using as the baseline scenario the International Monetary Fund’s economic forecasts. The results show a widening gap in the region, associated with the differential economic capacity of these countries. Some bottlenecks are shared by most countries in the continent, especially in the themes of violence and infectious diseases. The latter is likely to improve faster than other health themes in the next decade, whereas improvements in the theme non-communicable diseases can be more challenging.

In this version, trans identities are no longer classified as a mental illness and are categorized as gender incongruence in the new chapter related to sexual health. Considering that discursive practices shape and are shaped by social practices and that the process of depathologization is marked by the concepts of medicalization and biomedicalization, this work identifies and analyzes the sources cited in the journalistic coverage produced in Brazil. The objective is to understand, based on the social actors who were selected, interviewed and cited as sources, the meanings constructed by the main newspapers in the country on the subject. It is observed that institutional sources from the health field compete with others from the legal field, with representatives of social movements and trans people, who speak for themselves.

Their basidiomes and fermentation broth extracts were screened in a bioassay panel that included three human cancer cells lines, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), the enzyme trypanothione reductase (TryR) from Trypanosoma cruzi, and amastigote forms of Leishmania amazonensis. Forty-two extracts representing 21 genera and 35 species presented activities higher than 60% in one or more assays employed in this study. Eighteen extracts were toxic to one or more human cancer cell lines. Extracts from Lentinus strigosus CCB 178 and Lentinus sp. UFMGCB 38 showed selectivity towards cancer cells as they showed only a minor impact on PBMCs. Six extracts suppressed PBMCs proliferation and showed low toxic effect to cancer cells. Thirty-four extracts inhibited the activity of the TryR. Of these, five showed low toxicity towards PBMCs. Extracts from Gymnopilus areolatus, Irpex lacteus, L. strigosus, Nothopanus hygrophanus, Pleurotus flabellatus, and unidentified Basidiomycetes were toxic to L. amazonensis.

An increase in platelet MPs (PMPs) has been observed in patients with higher platelet activation, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. This study has evaluated the levels of PMPs in patients with AD. It has also evaluated whether the levels of PMPs are associated with abnormalities in the lipidic and oxidative profiles. PMPs were determined in the plasma of 81 elderly subjects and no difference was observed between samples from AD patients and control group. However, comparisons between high and low producers of PMPs were made for lipidic and oxidative profiles biomarkers. Increased PMPs levels were observed in apolipoprotein E allele epsilon 4 (APOE4) carriers as compared to noncarriers. Also Lipoprotein(a) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances levels were increased in high MPs producers compared to low producers. It was concluded that the relationship in AD group among different inflammatory markers and PMPs is a stronger signal of important inflammatory response in this disease.

A projective interview was conducted with ten journalists with the help of a news panel, and the selection of participants was made using the snowball technique. From this, the results indicated that violence occurred through approaches in the streets, most often in the form of verbal aggression by supporters of the current federal government (2019-2022), causing psychological suffering and difficulty in the development of work activities by journalists. It is necessary that violence against journalists remains on the agenda after the pandemic and opens new perspectives for future lines of research that can improve the protection protocols of communication professionals Humans, Journalism, Workplace Violence, COVID-19, Safety Measures, Psychological Stress, Federal Government, Aggression, Occupational Stress health",Ciências da Saúde,Saúde Coletiva,Saúde Pública,Ciências Humanas,Ciência Política,Estado e Governo
191,"Silent Orthohantavirus Circulation Among Humans and Small Mammals from Central Minas Gerais, Brazil New World orthohantaviruses are emerging RNA viruses that cause hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS). These viruses are a burden to public health around the world with a lethality rate of around 60%. In South America, rodents of Sigmodontinae subfamily are the main reservoirs of orthohantaviruses. We described a serosurvey for orthohantaviruses circulation in an apparently healthy human population and small mammals from rural areas in Central Minas Gerais State, Brazil. A total of 240 individuals and 50 small mammals (26 rodents belonging to 10 different species and 24 marsupials from 4 different species) were sampled during 2012-2013. The seroprevalence rates of IgG/IgM antibodies in humans were 7.1 and 1.6%, respectively. Only one rodent, an Oligoryzomys nigripes captured in peridomestic area, tested positive for IgG antibodies and viral RNA. Our findings suggest a silent circulation of orthohantaviruses in a region of intensive agriculture production. The detection of seropositive humans in an area with a lack of previous HCPS reports highlights potential oligosymptomatic cases and the need for surveillance strategies that could reduce the risk of future outbreaks.

192,"Prostaglandin e2 induces ovulation in prepubertal mice The objective of this study was to determine the ability of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2 ) to induce ovulation and expression of PGE2 receptor (EP2 and EP4) and COX genes (COX-1 and COX-2) in the ovary and pituitary of prepubertal mice. The positive control consisted of the application of 5 µg of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH, n = 29); the negative control applied 0.5 mL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS, n=31); the treatment tested the application of 250 µg of PGE2 (n = 29), making a total of 89 prepubertal mice (BALB/c). Mice were euthanized 14 to 15 h after treatments to detect ovulation and tissue collection. A Chi-square test was used to compare the proportion of animals ovulating. Gene expressions and number of ovulation were analyzed by one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s test was used to compare means among groups. A greater proportion of mice (P < 0.001) ovulated after receiving GnRH (89.7%, 26/29) compared to PGE2 group (58.6%, 17/29). However, the proportion was higher compared to those treated with PBS (0%, 0/31). Ep2 gene expression in the pituitary was > two-fold higher (P < 0.05) in the PGE2 group compared to the PBS and GnRH groups. Further, PGE2 stimulated Cox1 (2.7 fold, P < 0.05) while GnRH stimulated Cox2 expression (6.5 fold, P < 0.05) in the pituitary when compared to the PBS group. In conclusion, our results support the hypothesis that PGE2 can induce ovulation in prepubertal mice with a concomitant increase in Ep2 and Cox1 gene expression in the pituitary gland. © 2021, Universidade de Sao Paulo.

193,"Terminal 13p deletion in squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciureus) with differentiated phenotype Background The taxonomic classification of squirrel monkeys is often controversial issue offering many different information. The classification of captive animals is difficult due to the phenotypic similarities between the presented species, which is observed mainly in coat coloration. Methods Results and conclusions The objective of this study was to analyze the chromosome pattern of one squirrel monkey with off standard physical characteristics, which is kept in the Laboratory Animals Breeding Center in Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil, and try to establish some correlations. Chromosomes were obtained using lymphocyte culture technique. Evaluation of G bands showed a terminal deletion in one chromosome of pair 13. The association of the results found with the different phenotypic characteristics led us to classify it as a Saimiri sciureus specimen with a structural chromosomal change, possibly allowing the expression of hemizygous alleles. chromosome deletion,facial dimorphism,karyotype,Saimiri Journal of Medical Primatology",Ciências Agrárias,Medicina Veterinária,Clínica e Cirurgia Animal,Ciências Biológicas,Genética,Genética Animal
194,"Sources for a history of the Manguinhos Hospital The present study presents sources for a history of the Manguinhos Hospital (today the Brazilian National Institute of Infectious Diseases), which for the most part are found in the Archives and Documentation Department of the Casa de Oswaldo Cruz, but also in the administration's own collection (in boxes which are still classified informally) as well as the collection of the Brazilian National Library, in the Memorias do Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, and in the Brazilian Ministry of Culture's Audiovisual Technical Center. It also presents a typology of these sources, and shows their analytical potential for the history of health sciences and more specifically, of clinical research, medicine, and public health in Brazil between 1918 and 2018. history of medicine,Manguinhos Hospital,clinical research História, Ciência, Saúde - Manguinhos",Ciências da Saúde,Saúde Coletiva,Saúde Pública,Ciências Humanas,História,História das Ciências
195,"A construção dos prontuários como expressão da prática dos profissionais de saúde The focus of the paper is the construction of medical records by health professionals in two public health assistance services for pregnant teenagers. The medical record, beyond its judicial character, must be understood nowadays as a tool for promoting communication between the staff members, as well as between staff and patients, an instrument that mediates communication actions. Based on Michel Foucault's historical approach to registration as part of a disciplinary technology that emerges together with the modern hospital and clinical view, it was identified that health professionals neglect the communicative aspect, according to the concept of 'communicative acting' developed by Jürgen Habermas, of the registration action, and show a conception of clinical procedures based on 'secrecy' rather than a social construction of new knowledge.

196,"Knowledge translation strategies for dissemination with a focus on healthcare recipients: an overview of systematic reviews Background While there is an ample literature on the evaluation of knowledge translation interventions aimed at healthcare providers, managers, and policy-makers, there has been less focus on patients and their informal caregivers. Further, no overview of the literature on dissemination strategies aimed at healthcare users and their caregivers has been conducted. The overview has two specific research questions: (1) to determine the most effective strategies that have been used to disseminate knowledge to healthcare recipients, and (2) to determine the barriers (and facilitators) to dissemination of knowledge to this group. Methods This overview used systematic review methods and was conducted according to a pre-defined protocol. A comprehensive search of ten databases and five websites was conducted. Both published and unpublished reviews in English, Spanish, or Portuguese were included. A methodological quality assessment was conducted; low-quality reviews were excluded. A narrative synthesis was undertaken, informed by a matrix of strategy by outcome measure. The Health System Evidence taxonomy for consumer targeted strategies was used to separate strategies into one of six categories. Results We identified 44 systematic reviews that describe the effective strategies to disseminate health knowledge to the public, patients, and caregivers. Some of these reviews also describe the most important barriers to the uptake of these effective strategies. When analyzing those strategies with the greatest potential to achieve behavioral changes, the majority of strategies with sufficient evidence of effectiveness were combined, frequent, and/or intense over time. Further, strategies focused on the patient, with tailored interventions, and those that seek to acquire skills and competencies were more effective in achieving these changes. In relation to barriers and facilitators, while the lack of health literacy or e-literacy could increase inequities, the benefits of social media were also emphasized, for example by widening access to health information for ethnic minorities and lower socioeconomic groups. Conclusions Those interventions that have been shown to be effective in improving knowledge uptake or health behaviors should be implemented in practice, programs, and policies-if not already implemented. When implementing strategies, decision-makers should consider the barriers and facilitators identified by this overview to ensure maximum effectiveness.

Each of the methinehydroxyl residue [the C-C-C-O torsion angle is -16.35 (17) °] and the piperidinyl group [distorted chair conformation] lies to one side of the quinolinyl ring system. The hydroxyl and carbonyl groups lie to either side of the molecule, enabling their participation in intermolecular interactions. Thus, the hydroxyl and carbonyl groups of two centrosymmetrically related molecules are bridged by two methanol molecules via O- H⋯O hydrogen bonds, leading to a four-molecule aggregate. These are linked into a supramolecular chain along the a axis via C-H⋯O interactions involving the hydroxyl-O atom. The chains assemble into layers that interdigitate along the c axis being connected by C-H⋯F interactions. data-to-parameter ratio = 16.0; mean σ(C-C) = 0.002 Å; R factor = 0.040; single-crystal X-ray study; T = 120 K; wR factor = 0.110 Acta Crystallographica Section E: Structure Reports Online",Ciências Exatas e da Terra,Química,Química Orgânica,Ciências Exatas e da Terra,Química,Química Inorgânica
198,"Description of three new species of biting midge of the genus Atrichopogon Kieffer (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) from Brazilian Amazon Three new species of Atrichopogon with spotted wings of the family Ceratopogonidae (Diptera: Culicomorpha) from the Amazonas State of Brazil are described and illustrated. Male and female specimens of Atrichopogon janseni sp. nov., A. riopardensis sp. nov., and A. sergioluzi sp. nov. were associated by wing pigmentation patterns: with two darker spots, one over r-m and the other one in cell r3, posterior to the apex of R3. Male A. janseni sp. nov. have tergite 9 that is 2.5 ? as broad as long, not extending to the apex of gonocoxite, and sternite 9 stout, sub-trapezoidal, with distal margin with a row of stout spines; gonostylus of A. janseni sp. nov. is spatulate, with distinct middle notch. Atrichopogon riopardensis sp. nov. is separated from other species with similar wing patterns and forked gonostylus, with gonostylus forked near midlength, with longitudinal furrow, inner portion short and fingernail-like, outer portion elongate and apically curved directed mesally; outer portion is 4 ? longer than inner, with one long seta in basal 1/3. Contrastingly, A. sergioluzi sp. nov. has a small fork at the apex of gonostylus, and cercus broad basally with rounded tip. Females of the three new species are very similar (as are other females in this group), and it is probably not possible to distinguish them using the morphological features described. With the addition of the three new species described here, there are now known 15 Neotropical species of Atrichopogon with pigmented wings.

199,"A Genome-wide Association Study Identifies SERPINB10, CRLF3, STX7, LAMP3, IFNG-AS1, and KRT80 As Risk Loci Contributing to Cutaneous Leishmaniasis in Brazil Background: Our goal was to identify genetic risk factors for cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) caused by Leishmania braziliensis. Methods: Genotyping 2066 CL cases and 2046 controls using Illumina HumanCoreExomeBeadChips provided data for 4 498 586 imputed single-nucleotide variants (SNVs). A genome-wide association study (GWAS) using linear mixed models took account of genetic diversity/ethnicity/admixture. Post-GWAS positional, expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) and chromatin interaction mapping was performed in Functional Mapping and Annotation (FUMA). Transcriptional data were compared between lesions and normal skin, and cytokines measured using flow cytometry and Bioplex assay. Results: Positional mapping identified 32 genomic loci associated with CL, none achieving genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10-8). Lead SNVs at 23 loci occurred at protein coding or noncoding RNA genes, 15 with eQTLs for functionally relevant cells/tissues and/or showing differential expression in lesions. Of these, the 6 most plausible genetic risk loci were SERPINB10 (Pimputed_1000G = 2.67 × 10-6), CRLF3 (Pimputed_1000G = 5.12 × 10-6), STX7 (Pimputed_1000G = 6.06 × 10-6), KRT80 (Pimputed_1000G = 6.58 × 10-6), LAMP3 (Pimputed_1000G = 6.54 × 10-6), and IFNG-AS1 (Pimputed_1000G = 1.32 × 10-5). LAMP3 (Padjusted = 9.25 × 10-12; +6-fold), STX7 (Padjusted = 7.62 × 10-3; +1.3-fold), and CRLF3 (Padjusted = 9.19 × 10-9; +1.97-fold) were expressed more highly in CL biopsies compared to normal skin; KRT80 (Padjusted = 3.07 × 10-8; -3-fold) was lower. Multiple cis-eQTLs across SERPINB10 mapped to chromatin interaction regions of transcriptional/enhancer activity in neutrophils, monocytes, B cells, and hematopoietic stem cells. Those at IFNG-AS1 mapped to transcriptional/enhancer regions in T, natural killer, and B cells. The percentage of peripheral blood CD3+ T cells making antigen-specific interferon-γ differed significantly by IFNG-AS1 genotype. Conclusions: This first GWAS for CL identified multiple genetic risk loci including a novel lead to understanding CL pathogenesis through regulation of interferon-γ by IFNG antisense RNA 1.
